The last thing to go will be the empty spacetime, which we know to have its own energy. Spacetime is pretty uniform, and spacetime is not limited by the speed of light. So at the end, all of the universe will sort of collapse towards a single point, though it is more like everywhere is shrinking at once. The effect is the same either way, anything that remains will hurtle towards the center. So if you could manipulate particles and energy to make your patch of spacetime last longer than the uniform rest of the universe, then you could ride that potentially infinitely fast collapse. Ideally, you correct course a tad and ride out the explosion. Our universe resides within a black hole, so when our universe is ending, it is probably because the black hole housing us has bled off too much energy through Hawking radiation, not only because the heat death of energy spreading out. The problem of heat death still exists, now at the multiverse level. We cannot witness another black hole with the same mass as ours, because we can only observe the inside. But the super massive ones we have at the center of galaxies would be the closest, so study of the death of one of those may give us the answers to the nature of the end of a universe and how to survive it. As all the disparate particles remaining in the universe smash together, they shoot out into the outer universe.

It is an exercise for the brain that has stood the test of time because it happens to work. It is also our only real direct exercise for the brain. You can do indirect things, like read or paint or improve your motor skills, but these are all indirect. Like you want to be fast but only play pickup basketball, you get in better shape but your heart health and speed would be much better if you did a running exercise, and you'd get in better shape while using less time. Or you want big biceps so you decide to carry boxes every day. It helps you be stronger, definitely, but it is not targeting the biceps like a lifting exercise could. Again, there is only ONE (please correct me if I'm wrong, mindfulness is kind of the same thing but I digress) surefire exercise for your brain; Meditation. After doing it just 5 minutes a day for a few weeks, there is observable growth in the prefrontal cortex. That's like the executive decision part of your brain, it's a big part of where \"you\" as in your consciousness resides. (how to meditate: sit with good posture (if possible), breathe through your nose, and count your breaths up to 5. After 5 or if you forget where you were, start over. As thoughts come to you, gently acknowledge where they are coming from and let them go, focus back on your breath. Thoughts that are harder to shake are like heavier weights. By struggling against them, you are working harder than when it is easy, so don't be discouraged. Focus on your breath like you haven't observed it before. When a kid is young, they see a brick wall it is interesting, later they learn that it is just another wall. Our brains are the same, just with different settings. You can choose to focus on a wall intently, and your brain can behave in similar ways to that of a learning child. In meditation, you pay attention to your breath, these physical sensations that you \"feel\" all of the time but do not pay attention to. Try to feel the air coming in your nose and into your lungs, or the way your chest rises and falls, or any other detail you can find.

I'm nearing 3 months of trying it and I feel I can comfortably sit with close to ideal posture on my sitbones. A yoga instructor once said that in a class, 'sitbones', and I had no clue what it even meant. To sit as she was suggesting, I had to twist my then-inflexible body in a way that seemed quite unnatural and uncomfortable. But as I have stretched, I've become more aware of my body mechanics. I don't have aches and pains outside of a heavy lifting day. Walking and running still mystify me, honestly, it's really like you're swinging two golf clubs simultaneously, except you also have the flick of a wrist motion of your foot itself as well. There are many variables and many good enough solutions. If walking was so simple, there wouldn't be any bow-legged people, and everyone would walk similarly. Running takes it to another level by increasing the range of possibilities. At full speed, Usain Bolt is doing what looks like a butt kick and high knees at the same time. But I digress, yoga/stretching is like meditation, your body responds well to the consistency.
