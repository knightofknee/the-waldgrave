We can learn from those interactions, but I don't see the need to judge a part of the universe for being how it is, even if that part is part of me. This brings us to the individual level. People exist on top of a collection of waves, constantly riding ups and downs. But we only observe people at one point at a time.

Everyone has ups and downs because that's the very nature of our universe, matter and existence is based on ripples. To promote existence as we know it, we want to push up the wavefunctions of others. To do that, we need to understand their waves, their magnitude, frequency, and where they are at right now. Getting in-sync is more important than it may initially seem, in our universe if you have two waves of equal magnitude and frequency destructively interfering (hitting each other when one is high and the other is low), they cancel each other out and both waves disappear.

It doesn't work all of the time, but it really seemed like some artists write to this style. Carly Rae Jepsen is great material for this, her use of neutral pronouns and lyrical style promotes it well. I was actually going to write about her album \"Dedicated\", with the song below lining up with the 'you is two' concept. This song would be the scene where the right brain, after trying to speak out through the use of music, after being just a witness for the most part, takes control and sings, but is also renouncing their temporary control of the 'words' in exchance for more control over the sound, or more control over HOW the individual goes about their life, while letting them choose the WHAT or figure out the WHY on their own later.

Tegan and Sara took material from their high school days and made music with the help of that. They wrote this album right as they were approaching the age of 40. Turning 30 soon myself, I vibe with the material. They are talking about how to grow with yourself, a midlife crisis of sorts, from the persective of a high schooler and a 40-year old simultaneously.

This song is taking comfort in the temporary nature of feelings, that even if you feel bad now, another "you" will have a slightly different slate that they work with, and it isn\'t "your" problem now. If you hold your breath as long as you can, you pass out, lose consciousness, and other parts of your brain take over.

By struggling against them, you are working harder than when it is easy, so don't be discouraged. Focus on your breath like you haven't observed it before. When a kid is young, they see a brick wall it is interesting, later they learn that it is just another wall. Our brains are the same, just with different settings. You can choose to focus on a wall intently, and your brain can behave in similar ways to that of a learning child. In meditation, you pay attention to your breath, these physical sensations that you \"feel\" all of the time but do not pay attention to.

A yoga instructor once said that in a class, 'sitbones', and I had no clue what it even meant.

Walking and running still mystify me, honestly, it's really like you're swinging two golf clubs simultaneously, except you also have the flick of a wrist motion of your foot itself as well. There are many variables and many good enough solutions. If walking was so simple, there wouldn't be any bow-legged people, and everyone would walk similarly. Running takes it to another level by increasing the range of possibilities. At full speed, Usain Bolt is doing what looks like a butt kick and high knees at the same time.
