Long term, one part of the Waldgrave is a nonprofit organization committed to creating free or at-cost open-source tools and products for people. What I find beautiful about technology is that once something is built, the incremental cost is tiny relative to its creation, so it can be shared easily.

To promote existence as we know it, we want to push up the wavefunctions of others. To do that, we need to understand their waves, their magnitude, frequency, and where they are at right now. Getting in-sync is more important than it may initially seem, in our universe if you have two waves of equal magnitude and frequency destructively interfering (hitting each other when one is high and the other is low), they cancel each other out and both waves disappear.

I've long liked the concept of thinking of love songs as one part of myself singing to me. If you are single, this trick can turn potentially sad songs into introspective ballads. It doesn't work all of the time, but it really seemed like some artists write to this style. Carly Rae Jepsen is great material for this, her use of neutral pronouns and lyrical style promotes it well. I was actually going to write about her album \"Dedicated\", with the song below lining up with the 'you is two' concept. This song would be the scene where the right brain, after trying to speak out through the use of music, after being just a witness for the most part, takes control and sings, but is also renouncing their temporary control of the 'words' in exchance for more control over the sound, or more control over HOW the individual goes about their life, while letting them choose the WHAT or figure out the WHY on their own later. I also hear snippets in all of Billie Eilish's music that fit, with self love at the core of her most recent album. The song \"my future\" is directly about singing a love song to her future self.\n\n      <!-- , while \"Therefore I am\" is great material to work with. \"I think, therefore I am\" is the standard phrase, but you know other parts of your brain exist separate from your conscousness. Do those other parts think? -->\n      <!-- (Discuss Carly Rae and the Sound, and discovery of Hey I'm just like You) -->\n    </p>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6o0EN7CoLao\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p>\n      At this time, I was listening to 'Hey I'm Just like You' on repeat often, and after I heard a lyric in this light, I couldn't not hear it. Maybe parts of this are obvious, but I argue that every character in this album is a different part of the same person, the person singing and the audience. To demonstrate, I will break down the key lyrics from each song below. One important item to note first is the nature of this album. Tegan and Sara took material from their high school days and made music with the help of that. They wrote this album right as they were approaching the age of 40. Turning 30 soon myself, I vibe with the material. They are talking about how to grow with yourself, a midlife crisis of sorts, from the persective of a high schooler and a 40-year old simultaneously. Your relationship with yourself is the center of this album. The plot that ties the songs together is this self relationship evolving over time.\n      <!-- Start going through the songs in order, hitting highlights -->\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      Hold My Breath Until I Die\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('Hold My Breath Until I Die')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\n      The core concept of this song confused me but it starts with brain concept (also found in The Fall) that the \"we\" we most associate with is a stream of consciousness. Not a single unbroken thought, but the cumulative thoughts that you pile up while awake. That is the immediate \"you\". This song is taking comfort in the temporary nature of feelings, that even if you feel bad now, another \"you\" will have a slightly different slate that they work with, and it isn't \"your\" problem now. If you hold your breath as long as you can, you pass out, lose consciousness, and other parts of your brain take over. When you \"wake up\", your brain has already been changed directly as it edits things during sleep. This starts our story by establishing that the MC is curious about how the brain works and is interested in manipulating it because of some level of struggle.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      Hey, I'm Just like You\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics(`Hey, I'm Just like You`)\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\n      \"Stranded and I'm so lost, my mind is wired\nOvercome and overdone, my fate is on fire\nEat the drugs and dance to screaming in my head\nI'm so happy that we're friends, me and you\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      \"Together in the light, I swear all for you\nTonight in the dark, we're seeing colors\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The first other 'self' we are introduced is the confident, drug-fueled self. T&amp;S have talked before about their LSD use when they were young. A litte messed up and unsure of yourself, you lean on this version of yourself, it's \"fun you\". As the chorus emphasizes, there is a lot of power in this full embracement of self that the lifestyle enables. She feels empowered by this inner self she has found, and the relationship they've established.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      I’ll Be Back Someday\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('I’ll Be Back Someday')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>Now our main character is bored with their current/past self, and they are boldly going outward. They are not killing their past self necessarily, but they are ditching it in any direction, like an animal in a trap. they have found that they have been lying to themselves, or not living up to their own expectations and know that to get to where they want to be, they can't stay here. We hit a fun-damental problem with the brain and consciousness: it is fully shaped by the past, it wants to guess the future, and it only exists in the now.

The chorus discusses lying, pushing you to learn for yourself, question everything even if it is coming from yourself. The \"They\" in the title is both the voices of other people and the inner voices of the MC. In terms of brain science, thoughts and feelings aren't really directly controllable, only how we react to them. MC feels burned by their brain in its current state, and is trying to reevaluate her relationship with her brain. </p>\n    <h5>\n      Hello, I’m Right Here\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics(`Hello, I’m Right Here`)\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>This song goes back to the consciousness theme of the first song. 'Until I've done all that I can', that until could refer to until the day is over. \"Hello, I'm right here\" is the answer to that potential 'death', fully embracing the present</p>\n    <h5>\n      I Don’t Owe You Anything\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics(`I Don’t Owe You Anything`)\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>The struggle is full-fledged, the MC has reverted back in their ways many times, but she have reached a limit.

You can learn like reading a book about someone else, but overly judging yourself doesn't do anything productive. You can just live as best you can. (wanted something better than this) She is facing the doubts while being thankful \"who am I disagree\" really does hit well, she is thankful for who she has been and the comforting music makes it sound like the comfort is working against the doubts</p>\n    <h5>\n      Keep Them Close ’Cause They Will Fuck You Too\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('Keep Them Close ’Cause They Will Fuck You Too')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>Here we start to solve the problem. Starting something new can be hard. But now we have a self that is helpful. It seems to be that inner self from before, but now evolved. Instead of working against her inner selves, she is incorporating them in herself a bit.</p>\n    <h5>\n      We Don’t Have Fun When We’re Together Anymore\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('We Don’t Have Fun When We’re Together Anymore')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>The title describes the stage in the relationship with the youthful and/or drug-related persona. She is tired of her own bullshit. It also works well the angle of the inner right brain (RB) talking to her. She is tired of the drinking, tired of all the crap she is doing that never takes the time to enjoy her own mind. She is only ever bored and then trying to do something else. Now RB lamenting not being able to help. \"Promised myself I wouldn't let you get this way this time'... 'what you gonna do whe you wake up in someone else's head?'. 'All we get when we get together is bored'. Her relationship with herself is at its lowpoint. She is stuck, \"close my eyes and fall behind\", sleep is not a sufficient escape for her because her behaviors have her trapped. \"Have another drink it'll make you cool, it'll make you you\". It's a cycle she's grown acccustomted to, and she is not getting anything from it anymore.</p>\n    <h5>\n      You Go Away and I Don’t Mind\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('You Go Away and I Don’t Mind')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>The stage of acceptance is here, she is ready to leave her past self behind. She still feels the same way, but wants to grow. \"it's your mind that matters most, it's your mind that makes you mine\" describes the relationship of RB on the nose, RB is singing to her here. As much as she wants to leave this part of herself in the past, she is now on better terms with the parts she is choosing to leave behind. </p>\n    <h5>\n      All I Have to Give the World Is Me\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('All I Have to Give the World Is Me')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\"Faced Myself in the Mirror Last night, I looked for things you said you liked\nThe person I am when no one's around,\nThe girl I don't want to be found\"</p>\n<p>(chorus)</p>\n<p>\n  \"All I have to give this world is me, and that's it\nAll I have to show this world is me, and that's it\nJust me, just me, just me\nAnd that's it\"\n</p>\n\"Convinced myself not to be so strange\nI hope I still take your breath away\nI look in the mirror, I see the face\nThe one who worries, it can change\nYou don't have to change, you don't have to change\nYou don't have to change\"\n\n<p>\n  \"Staring down my two halves in the glass\nFeels like a heart attack\nTelling me to choose one or the other\nI get so panicked\nI don't wanna lose, but if I choose love\nWhat will happen then?\nStaring down my two halves in the glass\nWhat then?\nGo ahead and choose, go ahead and choose\nGo ahead and choose\"\n\n</p>\n<p>\n  That's kind of most of the song, but it all seems to finally be explicitly talking about her two inner selves, her inner (RB) self and the active consciousness that is her. The chorus brings home the idea of embracing yourself as you are, and being yourself unabashedly. She has finally realized that theres only one, herself, her divisions are all self-made. Her choice of who to be is moot because all she can do is be herself. In the process, she is learning how to love herself. The song ends with conflict, \"I don't wanna lose, but if I choose love, What will happen then? Staring down my two halves in the glass What then\". I think this conflict is saying, 'if I choose to love myself, how do I resolve what I am versus what I want to be?' But earlier she says \"Don't you ever wanna change?\", I think her choice to love herself is her motivation to want change, to move towards who she knows she is in comparison to who she sees in the mirror.\n</p>\n    <div>\n      <div id='rg_embed_link_4726856' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='4726856'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Tegan-and-sara-hold-my-breath-until-i-die-lyrics'>“Hold My Breath Until I Die” by Tegan and Sara</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/4726856/embed.js'></script>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position:-webkit-sticky;position:sticky;top:0;bottom:0;\">\n    <Song v-bind:lyrics=\"song\"/>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\n// strats:\n// the quotes get in the way, need to refer to them as you scroll, +  a lock lyrics functionality\nimport songsData from '../assets/TandSSongs'\nimport Song from './Song'\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'TeganAndSara',\n  props: { },\n  data () {\n    return {\n      songs: songsData,\n      song: ['']\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    showLyrics: function (title) {\n      var newSong = this.songs.find(x => x.title === title)\n      if (newSong !== undefined) this.song = newSong.lyrics\n    }\n  },\n  components: { Song }\n}\n</script>\n\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\n<style scoped>\n\np {\n  margin: 0 5%;\n}\n\niframe {\n  margin: 2% 0;\n}\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/TeganAndSara.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticStyle:{\"display\":\"flex\",\"justify-content\":\"center\",\"align-items\":\"center\"},attrs:{\"id\":\"newOuterShell\"}},[_c('div',{staticStyle:{\"display\":\"flex\",\"justify-content\":\"center\",\"flex-direction\":\"column\",\"align-items\":\"center\"}},[_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"\\n      'Hey I'm Just like You', the other You, and self love in love songs\\n    \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h5',[_vm._v(\"\\n      The Scientific Foundation:\\n    \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('iframe',{attrs:{\"width\":\"560\",\"height\":\"315\",\"src\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfYbgdo8e-8\",\"title\":\"YouTube video player\",\"frameborder\":\"0\",\"allow\":\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\",\"allowfullscreen\":\"\"}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n      The above video explains the concept of another \\\"you\\\" inside of your brain. I've long liked the concept of thinking of love songs as one part of myself singing to me. If you are single, this trick can turn potentially sad songs into introspective ballads. It doesn't work all of the time, but it really seemed like some artists write to this style. Carly Rae Jepsen is great material for this, her use of neutral pronouns and lyrical style promotes it well. I was actually going to write about her album \\\"Dedicated\\\", with the song below lining up with the 'you is two' concept. This song would be the scene where the right brain, after trying to speak out through the use of music, after being just a witness for the most part, takes control and sings, but is also renouncing their temporary control of the 'words' in exchance for more control over the sound, or more control over HOW the individual goes about their life, while letting them choose the WHAT or figure out the WHY on their own later.

To demonstrate, I will break down the key lyrics from each song below. One important item to note first is the nature of this album. Tegan and Sara took material from their high school days and made music with the help of that. They wrote this album right as they were approaching the age of 40. Turning 30 soon myself, I vibe with the material. They are talking about how to grow with yourself, a midlife crisis of sorts, from the persective of a high schooler and a 40-year old simultaneously.

Ideally, there is a prize and the top project is also sanctioned by the city. No matter what the city does, I will promote it. We should make it easy for people to make free contributions to their city. The whole premise of open source should be perfect for the city of Chicago. It's free labor (the city is broke), the change process is transparent (the city is corrupt/incompetent, take your pick), but the people of the city are great (and we want to empower them).</p>\n    <p>\n      A later goal would be to make a leaderboard for contributions to the city, could have a line count board, and another board based on some sort of review tool that takes out line count inflation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A later, later goal is to take the github/open source approach to other parts of the functioning of the city. Every part of how the city works can be put there. Each step like it is a software function. Then people can post their complaints about how a particular process is broken, and they can even post solutions then. Those solutions are reviewed by the community on the same platforms like github, in the same way. As it develops, you can add rules for when the city must accept the change or respond with their disagreement.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Another project I want to build is called the More Perfect Platform.
