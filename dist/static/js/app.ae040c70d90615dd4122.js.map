I've long liked the concept of thinking of love songs as one part of myself singing to me. If you are single, this trick can turn potentially sad songs into introspective ballads. It doesn't work all of the time, but it really seemed like some artists write to this style. Carly Rae Jepsen is great material for this, her use of neutral pronouns and lyrical style promotes it well. I was actually going to write about her album \"Dedicated\", with the song below lining up with the 'you is two' concept. This song would be the scene where the right brain, after trying to speak out through the use of music, after being just a witness for the most part, takes control and sings, but is also renouncing their temporary control of the 'words' in exchance for more control over the sound, or more control over HOW the individual goes about their life, while letting them choose the WHAT or figure out the WHY on their own later.\n      <!-- (Discuss Carly Rae and the Sound, and discovery of Hey I'm just like You) -->\n    </p>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6o0EN7CoLao\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p>\n      At this time, I was listening to 'Hey I'm Just like You' on repeat often, and after I heard a lyric in this light, I couldn't not hear it. Maybe parts of this are obvious, but I argue that every character in this album is a different part of the same person, the person singing and the audience. To demonstrate, I will break down the key lyrics from each song below. One important item to note first is the nature of this album. Tegan and Sara took material from their high school days and made music with the help of that. They wrote this album right as they were approaching the age of 40. Turning 30 soon myself, I vibe with the material. They are talking about how to grow with yourself, a midlife crisis of sorts, from the persective of a high schooler and a 40-year old simultaneously. Your relationship with yourself is the center of this album. The plot that ties the songs together is this self relationship evolving over time.\n      <!-- Start going through the songs in order, hitting highlights -->\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      Hold My Breath Until I Die\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('Hold My Breath Until I Die')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\n      The core concept of this song confused me but it starts with brain concept (also found in The Fall) that the \"we\" we most associate with is a stream of consciousness. Not a single unbroken thought, but the cumulative thoughts that you pile up while awake. That is the immediate \"you\". This song is taking comfort in the temporary nature of feelings, that even if you feel bad now, another \"you\" will have a slightly different slate that they work with, and it isn't \"your\" problem now. If you hold your breath as long as you can, you pass out, lose consciousness, and other parts of your brain take over. When you \"wake up\", your brain has already been changed directly as it edits things during sleep. This starts our story by establishing that the MC is curious about how the brain works and is interested in manipulating it because of some level of struggle.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      Hey, I'm Just like You\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics(`Hey, I'm Just like You`)\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\n      \"Stranded and I'm so lost, my mind is wired\nOvercome and overdone, my fate is on fire\nEat the drugs and dance to screaming in my head\nI'm so happy that we're friends, me and you\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      \"Together in the light, I swear all for you\nTonight in the dark, we're seeing colors\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The first other 'self' we are introduced is the confident, drug-fueled self.

The chorus discusses lying, pushing you to learn for yourself, question everything even if it is coming from yourself. The \"They\" in the title is both the voices of other people and the inner voices of the MC. In terms of brain science, thoughts and feelings aren't really directly controllable, only how we react to them.

You can learn like reading a book about someone else, but overly judging yourself doesn't do anything productive. You can just live as best you can. (wanted something better than this) She is facing the doubts while being thankful \"who am I disagree\" really does hit well, she is thankful for who she has been and the comforting music makes it sound like the comfort is working against the doubts</p>\n    <h5>\n      Keep Them Close ’Cause They Will Fuck You Too\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('Hold My Breath Until I Die')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>Here we start to solve the problem.

She is tired of the drinking, tired of all the crap she is doing that never takes the time to enjoy her own mind. She is only ever bored and then trying to do something else. Now RB is taunting her. \"I wouldn't let you get this way this time, get lost this time' 'what you gonna do whe you wae up in someone else's head?''All we get when we get together is bored'. Her relationship with herself is at its lowpoint.

As much as she wants to leave this part of herself in the past, it's all just parts of her brain. She can leave memories and thoughts in the past, even if they are part of how she became who she is. </p>\n    <h5>\n      All I Have to Give the World Is Me\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('Hold My Breath Until I Die')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\"Faced Myself in the Mirror Last night, I looked for things you said you liked\nThe person I am when no one's around,\nThe girl I don't want to be found\"</p>\n<p>(chorus)</p>\n<p>\n  \"All I have to give this world is me, and that's it\nAll I have to show this world is me, and that's it\nJust me, just me, just me\nAnd that's it\"\n</p>\n\"Convinced myself not to be so strange\nI hope I still take your breath away\nI look in the mirror, I see the face\nThe one who worries, it can change\nYou don't have to change, you don't have to change\nYou don't have to change\"\n\n<p>\n  \"Staring down my two halves in the glass\nFeels like a heart attack\nTelling me to choose one or the other\nI get so panicked\nI don't wanna lose, but if I choose love\nWhat will happen then?\nStaring down my two halves in the glass\nWhat then?\nGo ahead and choose, go ahead and choose\nGo ahead and choose\"\n\n</p>\n<p>\n  That's kind of most of the song, but it all seems to finally be explicitly talking about her two inner selves, her inner (RB) self and the active consciousness that is her. The chorus brings home the idea of embracing yourself as you are, and being yourself unabashedly. She has finally realized that theres only one, herself, her divisions are all self-made. Her choice of who to be is moot because all she can do is be herself, so the question shifts from any judgements to 'what then?' and ends. There's a lot of mixed duality in these lyrics. If you loop the album, it goes straight back to \"late at night, when your words are eating me alive\", which exemplifies the up-down wave nature of progress. These concepts of growth apply to an ongoing struggle.\n</p>\n    <div>\n      <div id='rg_embed_link_4726856' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='4726856'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Tegan-and-sara-hold-my-breath-until-i-die-lyrics'>“Hold My Breath Until I Die” by Tegan and Sara</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/4726856/embed.js'></script>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position:-webkit-sticky;position:sticky;top:0;bottom:0;\">\n    <Song v-bind:lyrics=\"song\"/>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\n// strats:\n// the quotes get in the way, need to refer to them as you scroll, +  a lock lyrics functionality\nimport songsData from '../assets/TandSSongs'\nimport Song from './Song'\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'TeganAndSara',\n  props: { },\n  data () {\n    return {\n      songs: songsData,\n      song: ['']\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    showLyrics: function(title) {\n      console.log(\"yahooll\", title, \"-wee-\", this.songs)\n\n      var newSong = this.songs.find(x => x.title == title);\nconsole.log(\"yahoo2\", newSong.lyrics, \"-\", newSong['lyrics'])\n      if (newSong != undefined) this.song = newSong.lyrics\n    }\n  },\n  components: { Song }\n}\n</script>\n\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\n<style scoped>\n\np {\n  margin: 0 5%;\n}\n\niframe {\n  margin: 2% 0;\n}\n</style>\n\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/TeganAndSara.vue","<template>\n  <div style=\"display:flex;flexDirection:column;justifyContent:center\">\n    <h3>Lyrics: </h3>\n    <p v-for=\"lyricBlock, index in lyrics\" :key=\"index\">\n      {{lyricBlock}}\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'Song',\n  props: { lyrics: ['']}\n}\n</script>\n\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\n<style scoped>\n\np {\n  margin: 0 5%;\n}\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/Song.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticStyle:{\"display\":\"flex\",\"justify-content\":\"center\",\"align-items\":\"center\"},attrs:{\"id\":\"newOuterShell\"}},[_c('div',{staticStyle:{\"display\":\"flex\",\"justify-content\":\"center\",\"flex-direction\":\"column\",\"align-items\":\"center\"}},[_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"\\n      'Hey I'm Just like You', the other You, and self love in love songs\\n    \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h5',[_vm._v(\"\\n      The Scientific Foundation:\\n    \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('iframe',{attrs:{\"width\":\"560\",\"height\":\"315\",\"src\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfYbgdo8e-8\",\"title\":\"YouTube video player\",\"frameborder\":\"0\",\"allow\":\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\",\"allowfullscreen\":\"\"}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n      The above video explains the concept of another \\\"you\\\" inside of your brain. I've long liked the concept of thinking of love songs as one part of myself singing to me. If you are single, this trick can turn potentially sad songs into introspective ballads. It doesn't work all of the time, but it really seemed like some artists write to this style. Carly Rae Jepsen is great material for this, her use of neutral pronouns and lyrical style promotes it well. I was actually going to write about her album \\\"Dedicated\\\", with the song below lining up with the 'you is two' concept. This song would be the scene where the right brain, after trying to speak out through the use of music, after being just a witness for the most part, takes control and sings, but is also renouncing their temporary control of the 'words' in exchance for more control over the sound, or more control over HOW the individual goes about their life, while letting them choose the WHAT or figure out the WHY on their own later.\\n      \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('iframe',{attrs:{\"width\":\"560\",\"height\":\"315\",\"src\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6o0EN7CoLao\",\"title\":\"YouTube video player\",\"frameborder\":\"0\",\"allow\":\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\",\"allowfullscreen\":\"\"}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n      At this time, I was listening to 'Hey I'm Just like You' on repeat often, and after I heard a lyric in this light, I couldn't not hear it. Maybe parts of this are obvious, but I argue that every character in this album is a different part of the same person, the person singing and the audience. To demonstrate, I will break down the key lyrics from each song below. One important item to note first is the nature of this album. Tegan and Sara took material from their high school days and made music with the help of that. They wrote this album right as they were approaching the age of 40. Turning 30 soon myself, I vibe with the material. They are talking about how to grow with yourself, a midlife crisis of sorts, from the persective of a high schooler and a 40-year old simultaneously. Your relationship with yourself is the center of this album. The plot that ties the songs together is this self relationship evolving over time.\\n      \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h5',[_vm._v(\"\\n      Hold My Breath Until I Die\\n    \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('button',{attrs:{\"type\":\"click\"},on:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.showLyrics('Hold My Breath Until I Die')}}},[_vm._v(\"show lyrics\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n      The core concept of this song confused me but it starts with brain concept (also found in The Fall) that the \\\"we\\\" we most associate with is a stream of consciousness.

This song is taking comfort in the temporary nature of feelings, that even if you feel bad now, another \\\"you\\\" will have a slightly different slate that they work with, and it isn't \\\"your\\\" problem now.
