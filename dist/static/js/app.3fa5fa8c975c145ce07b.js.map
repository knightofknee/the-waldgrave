Getting in-sync is more important than it may initially seem, in our universe if you have two waves of equal magnitude and frequency destructively interfering (hitting each other when one is high and the other is low), they cancel each other out and both waves disappear.

Carl's Cut- Chance's Big Day and why you should listen again\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      This is one of my favorite rap albums of the past few years, but it didn't have a ton of popular success. Many attribute it to Chance talking about marriage, and maybe that doesn't do the same as sex and drugs. I attribute it primarily to the song order. Start the album on Roo and you are treated with 5 absolute bangers in a row, capturing your attention. Then a fun Ballin Flossin mixup for the central skit and a serious banger in 5 Year Plan. From there, I include everything in order except \"Town on the Hill\", it is super slow and I don't really get much from it. Zanies and Fools is amazing, then I go back to the original start of the album for those songs we skipped. We skipped them because they didn't have the strong initial hook, but they close out the album well. <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Vb7mU97NeAp1FN8EixQN5?si=10917f8fef234c58\">(Link to Playlist)</a>\n    </p>\n    <iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0Vb7mU97NeAp1FN8EixQN5?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n    <h2>\n      'Hey I'm Just like You', the other You, and self love in love songs\n    </h2>\n    <h5>\n      The Scientific Foundation:\n    </h5>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfYbgdo8e-8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p>\n      Okay so I'm a lazy writer but avid listener/daydreamer, so I've been thinking about this album for years now, and I only get more convinced each listen, that this album is a masterpiece. The adventures of wise mind and growth, this album is the best exploration of self love that I've found. -2022\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The above video explains the concept of another \"you\" inside of your brain. I've long liked the concept of thinking of love songs as one part of myself singing to me. If you are single, this trick can turn potentially sad songs into introspective ballads. It doesn't work all of the time, but it really seems like some artists write to this style. Carly Rae Jepsen is great material for this, her use of neutral pronouns and lyrical style promotes it well. I was actually going to write about her album \"Dedicated\", with the song below lining up with the 'you is two' concept. This song would be the scene where the right brain, after trying to speak out through the use of music, after being just a witness for the most part, takes control and sings, but is also renouncing their temporary control of the 'words' in exchance for more control over the sound, or more control over HOW the individual goes about their life, while letting them choose the WHAT or figure out the WHY on their own later. I also hear snippets in all of Billie Eilish's music that fit, with self love at the core of her most recent album. The song \"my future\" is directly about singing a love song to her future self.\n\n      <!-- , while \"Therefore I am\" is great material to work with. \"I think, therefore I am\" is the standard phrase, but you know other parts of your brain exist separate from your conscousness. Do those other parts think? -->\n      <!-- (Discuss Carly Rae and the Sound, and discovery of Hey I'm just like You) -->\n    </p>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6o0EN7CoLao\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p>\n      At this time, I was listening to 'Hey I'm Just like You' on repeat often, and after I heard a lyric in this light, I couldn't not hear it. Maybe parts of this are obvious, but I argue that every character in this album is a different part of the same person. They are the performer and the audience, and that relationship evolves as they age. To demonstrate, I will break down the key lyrics from each song below. One important item to note first is the nature of this album. Tegan and Sara took material from their high school days and made music with the help of that. They wrote this album right as they were approaching the age of 40. Turning 30 soon myself, I vibe with the material. They are talking about how to grow with yourself, a midlife crisis of sorts, from the persective of a high schooler and a 40-year old simultaneously. Your relationship with yourself is the center of this album. The plot that ties the songs together is this self relationship evolving over time.\n      <!-- Start going through the songs in order, hitting highlights -->\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      Hold My Breath Until I Die\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('Hold My Breath Until I Die')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\n      The core concept of this song confused me but it starts with brain concept (also found in The Fall) that the \"we\" we most associate with is a stream of consciousness. Not a single unbroken thought, but the cumulative thoughts that you pile up while awake. That is the immediate \"you\". This song is taking comfort in the temporary nature of feelings, that even if you feel bad now, another \"you\" will have a slightly different slate that they work with, and it isn't \"your\" problem now. If you hold your breath as long as you can, you pass out, lose consciousness, and other parts of your brain take over. When you \"wake up\", your brain has already been changed directly as it edits things during sleep. This starts our story by establishing that the MC is curious about how the brain works and is interested in manipulating it because of some level of struggle.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      Hey, I'm Just like You\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics(`Hey, I'm Just like You`)\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\n      \"Stranded and I'm so lost, my mind is wired\nOvercome and overdone, my fate is on fire\nEat the drugs and dance to screaming in my head\nI'm so happy that we're friends, me and you\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      \"Together in the light, I swear all for you\nTonight in the dark, we're seeing colors\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The first other 'self' we are introduced is the confident, drug-fueled self. T&amp;S have talked before about their LSD use when they were young. A litte messed up and unsure of yourself, you lean on this version of yourself, it's \"fun you\". As the chorus emphasizes, there is a lot of power in this full embracement of self that the lifestyle enables. She feels empowered by this inner self she has found, and the relationship they've established.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      I’ll Be Back Someday\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('I’ll Be Back Someday')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>Now our main character is bored with their current/past self, and they are boldly going outward. They are not killing their past self necessarily, but they are ditching it in any direction, like an animal in a trap. they have found that they have been lying to themselves, or not living up to their own expectations and know that to get to where they want to be, they can't stay here. We hit a fun-damental problem with the brain and consciousness: it is fully shaped by the past, it wants to guess the future, and it only exists in the now.

The chorus discusses lying, pushing you to learn for yourself, question everything even if it is coming from yourself. The \"They\" in the title is both the voices of other people and the inner voices of the MC. In terms of brain science, thoughts and feelings aren't really directly controllable, only how we react to them. MC feels burned by their brain in its current state, and is trying to reevaluate her relationship with her brain. </p>\n    <h5>\n      Hello, I’m Right Here\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics(`Hello, I’m Right Here`)\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>This song goes back to the consciousness theme of the first song.

You can learn like reading a book about someone else, but overly judging yourself doesn't do anything productive. You can just live as best you can. (wanted something better than this) She is facing the doubts while being thankful \"who am I disagree\" really does hit well, she is thankful for who she has been and the comforting music makes it sound like the comfort is working against the doubts</p>\n    <h5>\n      Keep Them Close ’Cause They Will Fuck You Too\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('Keep Them Close ’Cause They Will Fuck You Too')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>Here we start to solve the problem.

She is tired of her own bullshit. It also works well the angle of the inner right brain (RB) talking to her. She is tired of the drinking, tired of all the crap she is doing that never takes the time to enjoy her own mind. She is only ever bored and then trying to do something else. Now RB lamenting not being able to help. \"Promised myself I wouldn't let you get this way this time'... 'what you gonna do whe you wake up in someone else's head?'. 'All we get when we get together is bored'. Her relationship with herself is at its lowpoint. She is stuck, \"close my eyes and fall behind\", sleep is not a sufficient escape for her because her behaviors have her trapped. \"Have another drink it'll make you cool, it'll make you you\". It's a cycle she's grown acccustomted to, and she is not getting anything from it anymore.</p>\n    <h5>\n      You Go Away and I Don’t Mind\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('You Go Away and I Don’t Mind')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>The stage of acceptance is here, she is ready to leave her past self behind. She still feels the same way, but wants to grow. \"it's your mind that matters most, it's your mind that makes you mine\" describes the relationship of RB on the nose, RB is singing to her here. As much as she wants to leave this part of herself in the past, she is now on better terms with the parts she is choosing to leave behind. </p>\n    <h5>\n      All I Have to Give the World Is Me\n    </h5>\n    <button type=\"click\" v-on:click=\"showLyrics('All I Have to Give the World Is Me')\" >show lyrics</button>\n    <p>\"Faced Myself in the Mirror Last night, I looked for things you said you liked\nThe person I am when no one's around,\nThe girl I don't want to be found\"</p>\n<p>(chorus)</p>\n<p>\n  \"All I have to give this world is me, and that's it\nAll I have to show this world is me, and that's it\nJust me, just me, just me\nAnd that's it\"\n</p>\n\"Convinced myself not to be so strange\nI hope I still take your breath away\nI look in the mirror, I see the face\nThe one who worries, it can change\nYou don't have to change, you don't have to change\nYou don't have to change\"\n\n<p>\n  \"Staring down my two halves in the glass\nFeels like a heart attack\nTelling me to choose one or the other\nI get so panicked\nI don't wanna lose, but if I choose love\nWhat will happen then?\nStaring down my two halves in the glass\nWhat then?\nGo ahead and choose, go ahead and choose\nGo ahead and choose\"\n\n</p>\n<p>\n  That's kind of most of the song, but it all seems to finally be explicitly talking about her two inner selves, her inner (RB) self and the active consciousness that is her. The chorus brings home the idea of embracing yourself as you are, and being yourself unabashedly. She has finally realized that theres only one, herself, her divisions are all self-made. Her choice of who to be is moot because all she can do is be herself. In the process, she is learning how to love herself. The song ends with conflict, \"I don't wanna lose, but if I choose love, What will happen then? Staring down my two halves in the glass What then\". I think this conflict is saying, 'if I choose to love myself, how do I resolve what I am versus what I want to be?' But earlier she says \"Don't you ever wanna change?\", I think her choice to love herself is her motivation to want change, to move towards who she knows she is in comparison to who she sees in the mirror.\n</p>\n    <div>\n      <div id='rg_embed_link_4726856' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='4726856'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Tegan-and-sara-hold-my-breath-until-i-die-lyrics'>“Hold My Breath Until I Die” by Tegan and Sara</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/4726856/embed.js'></script>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position:-webkit-sticky;position:sticky;top:0;bottom:0;\">\n    <Song v-bind:lyrics=\"song\"/>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\n// strats:\n// the quotes get in the way, need to refer to them as you scroll, +  a lock lyrics functionality\nimport songsData from '../assets/TandSSongs'\nimport Song from './Song'\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'TeganAndSara',\n  props: { },\n  data () {\n    return {\n      songs: songsData,\n      song: ['']\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    showLyrics: function (title) {\n      var newSong = this.songs.find(x => x.title === title)\n      if (newSong !== undefined) this.song = newSong.lyrics\n    }\n  },\n  components: { Song }\n}\n</script>\n\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\n<style scoped>\n\np {\n  margin: 0 5%;\n}\n\niframe {\n  margin: 2% 0;\n}\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/TeganAndSara.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticStyle:{\"display\":\"flex\",\"justify-content\":\"center\",\"align-items\":\"center\"},attrs:{\"id\":\"newOuterShell\"}},[_c('div',{staticStyle:{\"display\":\"flex\",\"justify-content\":\"center\",\"flex-direction\":\"column\",\"align-items\":\"center\"}},[_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"\\n      Carl's Cut- Chance's Big Day and why you should listen again\\n    \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_vm._m(0),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('iframe',{staticStyle:{\"border-radius\":\"12px\"},attrs:{\"src\":\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0Vb7mU97NeAp1FN8EixQN5?utm_source=generator\",\"width\":\"100%\",\"height\":\"380\",\"frameBorder\":\"0\",\"allowfullscreen\":\"\",\"allow\":\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"\\n      'Hey I'm Just like You', the other You, and self love in love songs\\n    \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h5',[_vm._v(\"\\n      The Scientific Foundation:\\n    \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('iframe',{attrs:{\"width\":\"560\",\"height\":\"315\",\"src\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfYbgdo8e-8\",\"title\":\"YouTube video player\",\"frameborder\":\"0\",\"allow\":\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\",\"allowfullscreen\":\"\"}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n      Okay so I'm a lazy writer but avid listener/daydreamer, so I've been thinking about this album for years now, and I only get more convinced each listen, that this album is a masterpiece.

It doesn't work all of the time, but it really seems like some artists write to this style. Carly Rae Jepsen is great material for this, her use of neutral pronouns and lyrical style promotes it well. I was actually going to write about her album \\\"Dedicated\\\", with the song below lining up with the 'you is two' concept. This song would be the scene where the right brain, after trying to speak out through the use of music, after being just a witness for the most part, takes control and sings, but is also renouncing their temporary control of the 'words' in exchance for more control over the sound, or more control over HOW the individual goes about their life, while letting them choose the WHAT or figure out the WHY on their own later. I also hear snippets in all of Billie Eilish's music that fit, with self love at the core of her most recent album.

They are the performer and the audience, and that relationship evolves as they age. To demonstrate, I will break down the key lyrics from each song below. One important item to note first is the nature of this album. Tegan and Sara took material from their high school days and made music with the help of that. They wrote this album right as they were approaching the age of 40. Turning 30 soon myself, I vibe with the material. They are talking about how to grow with yourself, a midlife crisis of sorts, from the persective of a high schooler and a 40-year old simultaneously. Your relationship with yourself is the center of this album.

It is an exercise for the brain that has stood the test of time because it happens to work. It is also our only real direct exercise for the brain. You can do indirect things, like read or paint or improve your motor skills, but these are all indirect. Like you want to be fast but only play pickup basketball, you get in better shape but your heart health and speed would be much better if you did a running exercise, and you'd get in better shape while using less time. Or you want big biceps so you decide to carry boxes every day. It helps you be stronger, definitely, but it is not targeting the biceps like a lifting exercise could. Again, there is only ONE (please correct me if I'm wrong, mindfulness is kind of the same thing but I digress) surefire exercise for your brain; Meditation. After doing it just 5 minutes a day for a few weeks, there is observable growth in the prefrontal cortex. That's like the executive decision part of your brain, it's a big part of where \\\"you\\\" as in your consciousness resides. (how to meditate: sit with good posture (if possible), breathe through your nose, and count your breaths up to 5. After 5 or if you forget where you were, start over. As thoughts come to you, gently acknowledge where they are coming from and let them go, focus back on your breath. Thoughts that are harder to shake are like heavier weights. By struggling against them, you are working harder than when it is easy, so don't be discouraged. Focus on your breath like you haven't observed it before. When a kid is young, they see a brick wall it is interesting, later they learn that it is just another wall. Our brains are the same, just with different settings. You can choose to focus on a wall intently, and your brain can behave in similar ways to that of a learning child. In meditation, you pay attention to your breath, these physical sensations that you \\\"feel\\\" all of the time but do not pay attention to. Try to feel the air coming in your nose and into your lungs, or the way your chest rises and falls, or any other detail you can find.

That single mistake meant the distance to Japan was 12k Roman miles but he thought it was only 3k. He didn't have the boat tech to keep enough food for the journey, it didn't exist yet. He never would have left. He just “got lucky” that there was something before Japan. CC knew about Lief Erickson, he knew something was there. He also chose those results over the 1000+ year old results of Eratosthenes which had been tested over the centuries. The story and results of Eratosthenes also include his methods. How do you judge that math mistake? I think the hate of Christopher Colombus makes people want him to be an idiot. If you think he was an asshole, this should add up: Japan was an exotic civilization, luxury goods to trade, proper company to be had. There was no such promise from any ridiculous voyage to an unknown continent. But the asshole wanted his boat, and he didn't care if he risked the lives of all the people on the boat. One night while researching, he made the mistake and converted units incorrectly. The calculation gave him a glimpse of hope, and upon further scrutiny he curses poor Pierre and whoever decided to have a new unit of measure named the same as an old one, and screams, \\\"anyone would be fooled by this\\\".

A yoga instructor once said that in a class, 'sitbones', and I had no clue what it even meant. To sit as she was suggesting, I had to twist my then-inflexible body in a way that seemed quite unnatural and uncomfortable. But as I have stretched, I've become more aware of my body mechanics. I don't have aches and pains outside of a heavy lifting day. Walking and running still mystify me, honestly, it's really like you're swinging two golf clubs simultaneously, except you also have the flick of a wrist motion of your foot itself as well. There are many variables and many good enough solutions. If walking was so simple, there wouldn't be any bow-legged people, and everyone would walk similarly. Running takes it to another level by increasing the range of possibilities. At full speed, Usain Bolt is doing what looks like a butt kick and high knees at the same time.

You can do indirect things, like read or paint or improve your motor skills, but these are all indirect. Like you want to be fast but only play pickup basketball, you get in better shape but your heart health and speed would be much better if you did a running exercise, and you'd get in better shape while using less time. Or you want big biceps so you decide to carry boxes every day. It helps you be stronger, definitely, but it is not targeting the biceps like a lifting exercise could. Again, there is only ONE (please correct me if I'm wrong, mindfulness is kind of the same thing but I digress) surefire exercise for your brain; Meditation. After doing it just 5 minutes a day for a few weeks, there is observable growth in the prefrontal cortex. That's like the executive decision part of your brain, it's a big part of where \"you\" as in your consciousness resides. (how to meditate: sit with good posture (if possible), breathe through your nose, and count your breaths up to 5. After 5 or if you forget where you were, start over. As thoughts come to you, gently acknowledge where they are coming from and let them go, focus back on your breath. Thoughts that are harder to shake are like heavier weights. By struggling against them, you are working harder than when it is easy, so don't be discouraged. Focus on your breath like you haven't observed it before. When a kid is young, they see a brick wall it is interesting, later they learn that it is just another wall. Our brains are the same, just with different settings. You can choose to focus on a wall intently, and your brain can behave in similar ways to that of a learning child. In meditation, you pay attention to your breath, these physical sensations that you \"feel\" all of the time but do not pay attention to. Try to feel the air coming in your nose and into your lungs, or the way your chest rises and falls, or any other detail you can find. Focus your intent on your breath like Sauron's eye looking for Frodo)\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      Why Christopher Columbus nearly starved to death on his journey:\n    </h5>\n    <p>\nColumbus, in his own words, considered Arabic to be \"the mother of all languages.” It was the language of science from 8th to 12th centuries. Yet his biggest mistake came from reading Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly's \"Imago Mundi\", he assumed Roman miles when they were Arabic miles. That single mistake meant the distance to Japan was 12k Roman miles but he thought it was only 3k. He didn't have the boat tech to keep enough food for the journey, it didn't exist yet. He never would have left. He just “got lucky” that there was something before Japan. CC knew about Lief Erickson, he knew something was there. He also chose those results over the 1000+ year old results of Eratosthenes which had been tested over the centuries. The story and results of Eratosthenes also include his methods. How do you judge that math mistake? I think the hate of Christopher Colombus makes people want him to be an idiot. If you think he was an asshole, this should add up: Japan was an exotic civilization, luxury goods to trade, proper company to be had. There was no such promise from any ridiculous voyage to an unknown continent. But the asshole wanted his boat, and he didn't care if he risked the lives of all the people on the boat. One night while researching, he made the mistake and converted units incorrectly. The calculation gave him a glimpse of hope, and upon further scrutiny he curses poor Pierre and whoever decided to have a new unit of measure named the same as an old one, and screams, \"anyone would be fooled by this\". With no other viable options for getting a boat to explore the new world, Columbus saw his mistake as divine providence, a belief that only grew as his plan succeeded.\n    </p>\n    <h5>Christopher Columbus Conspiracy: One faulty calculation and a journey across the world?, or one brief mistranslation turned opportuniy and a heist partway across the world?</h5>\n    <p>Christopher Columbus was a time traveler imitating Chris Columbus. This math “mistake” was a brilliant find on his path to tricking the crown into giving him a ship and people. The original Chris Columbus realized the distance to Japan and devoted the next 20 years of his life or however it naturally happened to be able to build ships for the full distance to Japan. Chris, in the process of building big enough ships, made a business out of making the greatest navy at the time. The subsequent quick domination of the seas on the part of the Spanish lead to their dominance throughout the new world. The Time Traveling Columbus doesn't want to wait that long.  </p>\n    <h5>\n      Yoga\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n      I can only speak from experience, but if you are inflexible, daily yoga (10 minutes a day can suffice) has great quality of life benefits. I'm nearing 3 months of trying it and I feel I can comfortably sit with close to ideal posture on my sitbones. A yoga instructor once said that in a class, 'sitbones', and I had no clue what it even meant. To sit as she was suggesting, I had to twist my then-inflexible body in a way that seemed quite unnatural and uncomfortable. But as I have stretched, I've become more aware of my body mechanics. I don't have aches and pains outside of a heavy lifting day. Walking and running still mystify me, honestly, it's really like you're swinging two golf clubs simultaneously, except you also have the flick of a wrist motion of your foot itself as well. There are many variables and many good enough solutions. If walking was so simple, there wouldn't be any bow-legged people, and everyone would walk similarly. Running takes it to another level by increasing the range of possibilities. At full speed, Usain Bolt is doing what looks like a butt kick and high knees at the same time. But I digress, yoga/stretching is like meditation, your body responds well to the consistency. The \"time\" you lose each day is well-past saved by the stable building process, 6 days of 10 minutes a day of yoga will do more for you than one 60 minute yoga session, and those 10 minutes can be flexibly scheduled wherever.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n      Arm massaging for lifting\n    </h5>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jx-Bw97XHoA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p>\n      I've had problems with lifting and basketball causing elbow pain.

I was convinced, by my own personal experience and by my limited knowledge of neurology. Once upon a time, it was thought that the heart was where the 'soul' or conscousness resided. Now we say it is the brain. But we know that there is a lot that the brain does that our direct consciousness is not involved in, breathing, sleep, balance, regulation of the pumping of blood, translating stimuli, etc. It starts to add up to a lot of the brain, so to call ourselves the brain is inaccurate. We are more the activity of a certain region of the brain, connected to the rest, that serves as the chief executive of the brain (CEB?). The primary region that is us is the Prefrontal Cortex. It's part of the NeoCortex. Higher thought, incidentally, is found higher in the brain and that upper region of the brain where I found 'them'. I use 'them' or RB (right brain) to describe the potential other conscousness(es) in my brain. We, as the executives, are the only ones with the keys to spaceship that is your body. They are stuck inside, maybe able to see out a port, maybe not. In particular I refer to right brain, as that is where the neuroscience led me. If you perform a lobotomy on someone, if you cut the connection between left and right, the brain does strangely well. The person isn't obviously different, but their two sides exhibit different conscousnesses. Set up a sight-blocker beween the test subject's eyes, so left side is separate, they can't see the same things. Show the person's left eye a note saying 'pick up the red ball with your right hand', the subject will pick up the red ball. Asked why they picked up the red ball, they make up a reason, they don't know that they were shown the note, but their brain made up a reason for them. Now consider again, for these procedures, they were tested not long after, they didn't have growth spurred by massive loss. Implying, their brains operated in some similar fashion prior. Are these separate pieces of consciousness divided? Does your brain dream without you? What is my relationship with my potential hostage/partner consciousness?

I was convinced, by my own personal experience and by my limited knowledge of neurology. Once upon a time, it was thought that the heart was where the 'soul' or conscousness resided. Now we say it is the brain. But we know that there is a lot that the brain does that our direct consciousness is not involved in, breathing, sleep, balance, regulation of the pumping of blood, translating stimuli, etc. It starts to add up to a lot of the brain, so to call ourselves the brain is inaccurate. We are more the activity of a certain region of the brain, connected to the rest, that serves as the chief executive of the brain (CEB?). The primary region that is us is the Prefrontal Cortex. It's part of the NeoCortex. Higher thought, incidentally, is found higher in the brain and that upper region of the brain where I found 'them'. I use 'them' or RB (right brain) to describe the potential other conscousness(es) in my brain. We, as the executives, are the only ones with the keys to spaceship that is your body. They are stuck inside, maybe able to see out a port, maybe not. In particular I refer to right brain, as that is where the neuroscience led me. If you perform a lobotomy on someone, if you cut the connection between left and right, the brain does strangely well. The person isn't obviously different, but their two sides exhibit different conscousnesses. Set up a sight-blocker beween the test subject's eyes, so left side is separate, they can't see the same things. Show the person's left eye a note saying 'pick up the red ball with your right hand', the subject will pick up the red ball. Asked why they picked up the red ball, they make up a reason, they don't know that they were shown the note, but their brain made up a reason for them. Now consider again, for these procedures, they were tested not long after, they didn't have growth spurred by massive loss. Implying, their brains operated in some similar fashion prior. Are these separate pieces of consciousness divided? Does your brain dream without you? What is my relationship with my potential hostage/partner consciousness? Those were the questions I set out with, and I think it's about time I share the truth of what I, or rather we, found.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>ch 2</h3>\n  <p>\n    (Interviews with patients follow)\n  </p>\n  <div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column\">\n    <span>\"\"</span>\n    <span></span>\n    <span></span>\n    <span></span>\n\n    <span>(after some doubt)</span>\n    <span>\"Do you know why meditation has been used for at least 7,000 years?\"</span>\n    <span>\"Yeah, it's called sitting on your ass in some languages, no real surprise there\"</span>\n    <span>\"It's been a dedicated practice for 7 thousand years because it works.

(if they have a named opponent, that opponent gets a spot to post their view on the issue (character restricted (1000?) with link to more)). The other moderator is the general public upvoting, downvoting and commenting. Users get a score based on their response rate to questions with sufficient upvotes. The responses are also scored based on general user feedback. Instead of the normal up/down vote for those, the buttons are \\\"answered the question clearly\\\", \\\"avoided the question\\\", and \\\"gave a partial answer\\\".

I propose that we do all we can to make our city safe, while protecting our privacy and civil rights through clear processes with audit trails. I want cameras on every city street, with the footage only being accessible for violent crimes and all searches are recorded. Everything goes through general machine learning, but any viewing of footage has to be sanctioned. Any additional use of the cameras beyond violent crime would require a city vote. My other security element is universal basic income. We can set up a UBI program with what we have, limited in count or amount or both, and set it up so that if you later have an income above x% of the poverty line, y% of your additional income goes to the UBI fund. The tax drastically lowers when the UBI fund is growing (it keeps growing so that one day it won't need the tax). Alongside the street cameras, I want all cop cameras linked live whenever they are active. This footage will be fed to the police and other help teams. The footage will be fed into machine learning and any escalated scenarios will be highlighted. For every cop, there is a live support line. They hit a button or say the right thing, they can raise their status themselves as well. They are then connected to the best available support staff who see and hear the situation live. This goes beyond accountability, failure is failure. This establishes clear perfomance: the officers do their job normally following basic procedure with cameras on at all times, and then in escalated scenarios the responsibility falls first on the police support team giving orders based on all information at hand. The rest of the responsibility falls on the watchers. This group oversees and audits the cam footage alongside the supporting communication of the police. They hear and see everything because they are part of the same general support team. The goal of this setup is to reduce the obvious risk of individual police officers being unprepared for escalated situations by prioritizing supporting them by using tech to bring the experience of the veteran officers to the ear of every officer. Hard decisions are made, and this will give a space for criticizing choices as they are being made. Alternatives from other groups like mental health support can be brought in quickly. We ask officers to do too much with too little support. This would make new officers' lives much better while providing accountability, and we need a lot of new officers now.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Second is education, the 2 priorities I see are providing the best possible support for new teachers, and having the best teachers teach the other teachers (they can still teach students directly or not). But I think the ROI of helping our teachers is immense. For every level and every class in the CPS, we should have all possible materials prepared for new teachers. New teachers should be given every advantage and should have experienced teachers alongside them. I want Chicago to be the top destination for new teachers. And with the UBI plan, I want to enable anyone of any income or age to become a student again if they want.\n  </p> -->\n  <p>\n    Third is transportation.

(Alongside it, the city could highlight a chicago star citizen or something? each day with a stars gained count (count based on changing X lamp posts per day))\n  </p>\n  <h3>Other short term plans for Chicago</h3>\n  <p>\n    All El signs will ALWAYS show the next incoming trains for each line they are serving. No notices or ads blocking the whole screen. All you need is a color and a number(minutes), there should always be space for them. This would be a great starting project for moving everything possible to an open source format.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Concrete-protected bike lane highways north-south and east-west. Track bike crashes and build more protected bike lanes wherever they seem needed. Map out the active cycling population of Chicago so we can get accurate simulations going and can optimize the bike lane making.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Set up a new independent process for review of police conduct and in exchange raise police wages to incentivize the new additions to the force that we need.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Force Bears to stay and build a bigger stadium in the same area, give them any land they need and let them pay for and own the stadium. For however much the city gives up in the deal, the city gains part ownership of the Bears. So for every dollar in profit the Bears take home, the city would get a percentage. If they leave, get the Jaguars here, the McCaskeys could clearly use some competition. The Bears go backwards and match the Cubs on the north side, the Jags join the Socks as the real team of the city (sorry I'm not sorry, they decided to stop competing, that isn't very Chicago of them).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Fred Hampton statue, somewhere prominent in the city. A plaque explaining how he was assassinated by the Chicago police, in a planned murder that included the FBI giving the police a detailed floor plan indicating where Fred Hampton slept. He was the potentially the best leader we have had, and the city has let his memory go improperly marked. Despite having murdered the man, the police abuse of Fred Hampton didn't stop there, the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago helped block the renaming of a street after him. Not some bold change like renaming lakeshore drive, just one of the brown signs under the regular street signs. We have over a thousand of them, most go unchallenged, and most are not as deserving. They murdered him and his legacy, to let this injustice stand robs the city of a role model as well. Is there anything worse in this city's history that I should know of?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Violence in the city: the new police oversight system paired with the increased budget we need to hire and keep a competent police force will give us some basic tools we need. The real wins will come from building up. The education system needs an overhaul, new teachers need a support system to help them flourish where they are now suffering. Singapore has many best practices to learn from. New teachers should be taught by successful teachers who now focus on teaching teachers. Another big win comes in the form of Universal Basic Income, establishing a minimum income floor for all residents. I want all residents of Chicago to have access to a roof and a floor. This should provide means and hope to the kids out there currently mired by all this violence. This can start small, and as the budget gets balanced and we can afford it, it will rise. Imagine if a family member of yours found themselves homeless, or infirmed and in medical debt? I'd feel much better if I knew they had the simple bear necessities. Chicago is my family, I believe that together we can support our most vulnerable.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWhsVwVy9yg?start=830&end=848\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </p>\n  <h3>Long term plan for Chicago and Illinois</h3>\n  <p>\n    Universal basic income will not only support our most vulnerable neighbors, it will enable many people to take time to not only find a better job, but to pursue their own passions, whatever they may be. It sets a financial goal we want to reach, where the government financial holes are finally cauterized, and we start to get a tax surplus. Once we get a surplus, we shouldn't be taxing as much because the bill is paid. When we reach that point, additional income should be rewarded with a lower income tax that goes into the BE FUNd. The BE fund is set aside to grow until the gains in the BE fund are enough to fund the government, state and city taxes gone. The BE fund wants to give everyone the gift to be whoever they want to be.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To reach this lofty goal, the BE Fund starts small and grows alongside our ability to fund it. We want to tax the 1% to get this done, but we should provide incentive for them to stay, to come here. The pension problem should be understood as the government promising money that they didn't have, instead of just paying people. If you want to help someone for their future retirement in particular, buy an annuity for them. We need to stop the losses and put ourselves on a path of recovery. The UBI would start small in disadvantaged neighborhoods and then expand. After an agreed upon UBI level is reached, and other projects are funded, then taxes should be progressively decreased on everyone. It is important to note that the Universal Income Floor would be slowly built up.\n  </p>\n    <p>The initial 'Open Chicago' idea is that we have a coding competition, any open source project that benefits the city in any way. Ideally, there is a prize and the top project is also sanctioned by the city. No matter what the city does, I will promote it. We should make it easy for people to make free contributions to their city. The whole premise of open source should be perfect for the city of Chicago. It's free labor (the city is broke), the change process is transparent (the city is corrupt/incompetent, take your pick), but the people of the city are great (and we want to empower them).</p>\n    <p>\n      A later goal would be to make a leaderboard for contributions to the city, could have a line count board, and another board based on some sort of review tool that takes out line count inflation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A later, later goal is to take the github/open source approach to other parts of the functioning of the city. Every part of how the city works can be put there. Each step like it is a software function. Then people can post their complaints about how a particular process is broken, and they can even post solutions then. Those solutions are reviewed by the community on the same platforms like github, in the same way. As it develops, you can add rules for when the city must accept the change or respond with their disagreement.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Another project I want to build is called the More Perfect Platform. It will be a tool for me to present my own political platform, but more importantly, I want to make it for others to use as well. The idea can be summed up as a subreddit mixed with github with a more complicated comment system. It should make it easy for people to compare platforms side-by-side on specific topics. I'd also want to give the candidates a place to debate in long-form, so it's not the live bullshit of tv debates but still has a strong moderator in two forms, the first is the different logic fields that are required, like \"what is the top opposition view to your current view\"? (if they have a named opponent, that opponent gets a spot to post their view on the issue (character restricted (1000?) with link to more)). The other moderator is the general public upvoting, downvoting and commenting. Users get a score based on their response rate to questions with sufficient upvotes. The responses are also scored based on general user feedback. Instead of the normal up/down vote for those, the buttons are \"answered the question clearly\", \"avoided the question\", and \"gave a partial answer\". The main goal here is to lay out views clearly and enable direct democracy as best we can with the tools at hand. You will be able to use a drivers license to verify that you are a resident of the city or state, and your vote will go towards the score that shows first, the verified Resident voters. For active politicans, this should be the most useful aspect. We will have residents filtering the requests and opinions of residents, the non-tech equivalent is hard to imagine, a mob of millions of people sorting the opinions of millions simultaneously. Direct democracy has never been more feasible, it's about time we started developing appropriate tools in earnest. 'Who wants to be a Millionaire?' and their ask the audience button, or a reality tv show vote is all I've seen so far.\n    </p>\n    <!-- <p>\n      One feature is everyone has their own eye of sauron, they can put their focus on any one part of your platform.
