  {title: 'Hold My Breath Until I Die', lyrics: [`[Verse 1]
  Late at night, when your words are eating me alive
  Does it make you sad to leave me here like that?
  In my dreams, the blood runs from my eyes
  If I fall, will you catch me in your arms? (Catch me in your arms)`,

  `[Pre-Chorus]
  When you asked me who, I should have said it's you
  Now it seems like it will never be, will never be`,

  `[Chorus]
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright`,

  `[Verse 2]
  Shame on me 'cause I can't help fallin' at your feet
  It makes me mad to see you leave like that
  I'm so lost, running circles in my head
  If I jump, will you catch me in your arms? (Catch me in your arms)`,

  `[Pre-Chorus]
  When you asked me who, I should have said it's you
  Now it seems like it will never be, will never be`,

  `[Chorus]
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright`,

  `[Bridge]
  I said I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
  Does it bother you? (Bother you)
  Why does it bother you? (Bother you)
  I said I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
  Does it bother you? (Bother you)
  Why does it bother you? (Bother you)`,

  `[Chorus]
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright`,

  `[Outro]
  I said I'm sorry
  Does it bother you?
  Why does it bother you?
  I said I'm sorry
  Does it bother you?
  Why does it bother you?`]},
