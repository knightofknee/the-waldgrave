  {title: 'Hold My Breath Until I Die', lyrics: [`[Verse 1]
  Late at night, when your words are eating me alive
  Does it make you sad to leave me here like that?
  In my dreams, the blood runs from my eyes
  If I fall, will you catch me in your arms? (Catch me in your arms)`,

  `[Pre-Chorus]
  When you asked me who, I should have said it's you
  Now it seems like it will never be, will never be`,

  `[Chorus]
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright`,

  `[Verse 2]
  Shame on me 'cause I can't help fallin' at your feet
  It makes me mad to see you leave like that
  I'm so lost, running circles in my head
  If I jump, will you catch me in your arms? (Catch me in your arms)`,

  `[Pre-Chorus]
  When you asked me who, I should have said it's you
  Now it seems like it will never be, will never be`,

  `[Chorus]
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright`,

  `[Bridge]
  I said I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
  Does it bother you? (Bother you)
  Why does it bother you? (Bother you)
  I said I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
  Does it bother you? (Bother you)
  Why does it bother you? (Bother you)`,

  `[Chorus]
  Oh, if I hold my breath until I die, I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright
  Oh, if I (If I) hold my breath (Hold my)
  Until I die (Breath, I), I'll be alright`,

  `[Outro]
  I said I'm sorry
  Does it bother you?
  Why does it bother you?
  I said I'm sorry
  Does it bother you?
  Why does it bother you?`]},

  {title: "Hey, I'm Just like You", lyrics: [`[Verse 1]
  Stranded and I'm so lost, my mind is wired
  Overcome and overdone, my fate is on fire
  Eat the drugs and dance to screaming in my head
  I'm so happy that we're friends, me and you`,

  `[Pre-Chorus]
  I never feel invisible when you're around
  With you, I don't blend in with the millions
  Together in the light, I swear all for you
  Tonight in the dark, we're seeing colors`,

  `[Chorus]
  Hey, I'm just like you
  A little messed up and blue
  Hey, I'm just like you
  Not sure what the fuck I'm to do
  We're headstrong tonight (Tonight, tonight)
  Racing through the streets 'til we fly
  Gold-colored prisms of light (The light, the light)
  Headstrong tonight`,

  `[Verse 2]
  Sometimes, we get so tired of pretending like you're so strong
  Everyone you love has gone and decided that you're so wrong
  [Pre-Chorus]
  I always feel invincible when you're around
  You and me against the millions
  Together in the light, I swear all for you
  Tonight in the dark, we're seeing colors`,

  `[Chorus]
  Hey, I'm just like you
  A little messed up and blue
  Hey, I'm just like you
  Not sure what the fuck I'm to do
  We're headstrong tonight (Tonight, tonight)
  Racing through the streets 'till we fly
  Gold-colored prisms of light (The light, the light)
  Headstrong tonight`,

  `[Outro]
  We're headstrong tonight (Tonight, tonight)
  Racing through the streets 'til we fly
  Gold-colored prisms of light (The light, the light)
  Headstrong tonight`]},

  {title: `Iâ€™ll Be Back Someday`, lyrics: [`[Verse 1]
  Sit and watch my TV set
  What is on will make it better (Will make it better)
  I wanna call and ask, "What's up?"
  Go to dial, but then I stop (Why don't you call?)`,

  `[Pre-Chorus]
  "To the end, my friend," oh, what a lie
  Oh, what a lie
  If I could pretend, if I could lie
  If I could lie
  But I can't say
  No, I can't stay`,

  `[Chorus]
  I run, run, run, run, run away
  Get, get, get, get, get away
  I run, run, run, run, run away
  Get, get, get, get, get away
  But I'll be back someday
  I'll be back someday`,

  `[Verse 2]
  Like to read to you at night
  Like to read 'til you feel better (Until you're better)
  Now's the time for us to begin
  Not the time for us to give in (It's not the time)
  [Pre-Chorus]
  "To the end, my friend," oh, what a lie
  Oh, what a lie
  If I could pretend, if I could lie
  If I could lie
  But I can't say
  No, I can't stay`,

  `[Chorus]
  I run, run, run, run, run away
  Get, get, get, get, get away
  I run, run, run, run, run away
  Get, get, get, get, get away
  But I'll be back someday
  I'll be back someday`,

  `[Bridge]
  Know that feeling when you're cold
  How do you make it go away? (How do you make it go away?)
  Know that feeling when you're cold
  How do you make it go away? (How do you make it go away?)`,

  `[Pre-Chorus]
  "To the end, my friend," oh, what a lie (Lie, lie, lie, lie)
  Oh, what a lie
  If I could pretend, if I could lie (Lie, lie, lie, lie)
  If I could lie
  But I can't say
  No, I can't stay
  [Chorus]
  I run, run, run, run, run away
  Get, get, get, get, get away
  I run, run, run, run, run away
  Get, get, get, get, get away
  But I'll be back someday
  I'll be back someday
  But I'll be back someday
  I'll be back someday`]}
