# Dumbledore, one character realizes they know more than they should, realize they are a dumbledore and that’s how they catch one

# Snape starts the HP fan fiction, he is teaching Harry or someone else to protect their mind, snape reveals that there is a level dumbledore never reached, he always sought power and once DD’s mind was perfectly protected, he moved on to something new. Through meditation and therapy, snape discovered another level but told no one. He had an ego death experience and had a long conversation with lily via the stone. She’s the one that warns him of DD’s true nature, something she stumbled upon, DD hinted at it in his attempts to win her over. There are other wizards that know, most are far away for safety’s sake since no one knows DD’s limits.

"I can tell you more, but only in bits. You are clearly a natural at Occlumism or whatever, but you're in too deep with Dumbledore. You need to forget what you know, to maintain a perfectly ignorant version of yourself. So I'm going to temporarily pause communication between the hemispheres of your brain. Since you are the talker, we are gonna cover you up nice and good (sweet mask that puts half of someones head in a soundproof box)."

"Couldn't we just use memory charms?"

"I can do that on myself, but I can't imitate your brain like that. Cedric used memory charms, he was brilliant. DD's favorite at the time, though he'd obviously been grooming you for awhile. Watching you two compete drew DD's full attention. Moaning Myrtle, any of the other ghosts, a fly on the wall, a classmate or a professor. Dumbledore could have been any of them, all of them close enough to notice a sign of self-administered memory charms. When you show DD that you are playing this game on 'the next level', DD ups his level as well, no mercy. DD loves to keep the story going though, and hoped to find some collaborators, so he waited and took care of Cedric in the graveyard. You're going to be alone with him, one mistake and he makes you into a toy.

So for this method, you will unconsciously know things. If your left hand appears to be giving you a hint, follow it."

"Wait if it is the brains of the mission then what does that make me?"
"The perfect liar. You will make up explanations out of thin air and believe them instantly"
# Cedric was Snape’s first student for the mission.

# They can’t kill him, their plan rests on capture, preferably stuck as a newt, occasionally transformed into something that can communicate

# Have it start with the student talking about zen or brain science or both, then have snape talk to them about cutting brain down the middle with a spell that you can remove later, making you separate consciousnesses for a while

# Snape found this because he was given a dangerous procedure like zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, he discovers a way to undo it with magic, for his student he does the opposite

# A key for snape is he uses magic to be able to bridge the psychic gap, he is essentially using psychic magic to communicate between the two parts

# Snape keeps telling stories about himself or dumbledore

# Dumbledore could have one side that is nice, they gotta figure out how to imprison the evil side


# Snape’s strength is DD’s weakness

# My dumbledore has the horcruxes of several immortal wizards and uses them to control the wizards. They cannot expose him and cannot betray him. Some dark lords, some good ones, both out of public eye because of him. He made grindelwald commit the crimes so he could be the hero. He takes the horcruxes everywhere so the wizards are like his secret friends. The ones like grindelwald hold most of his mind, his body in Azkaban is nearly empty

# The fiery bird of life and death has a complicated history in magic, most of the old stories were smoothed out by Dumbledore, until today, and now we call them the magical embodiment of all that is good. Few recall the days of the Phoenix hunts, even fewer the reason why they were hunted. The spoils were beyond compare, but that’s not all that immortal beings bring. They are supremely intelligent and immortal, everyone still agrees on that. But they somehow believe Phoenix’s don’t care, don’t love, don’t hate those who destroy what they love. People today don’t even believe these higher beings can understand human language. The flames of fire warm and burn, and so do those of the Phoenix. But the Phoenix has no obvious fuel source, oxygen is unaffected. But magic isn’t. That’s why Phoenix’s are always found in the company of powerful mages, it was originally a formal contract. But smarter than magicians, they soon found they could get a much better deal without the contract. In exchange for the occasional help, a firebird could befriend a powerful mage in the prime of their development. Unaware of the absurd potential within themselves, these special mages never notice as 30% of their full magic is siphoned off. An emotional attachment was found to be particularly effective, if a Phoenix “dies” next to their partner, the rush of that 30% returning is associated with how much they love us. We can use our own magic for rebirth, though it takes a lot, we lose most of what we worked so hard to gather. But death is so emotional for you, even if it’s not real for us. And in that moment, in your fight among men, you give us a bit of your “soul”, your root magic source. That 30% potential that has been streaming into our blazing wings, we take it all, it’s future as well, into our next life. All the built up magic we save makes us that much stronger, a positive feedback loop that’s been going on for millennia. We grew greedy once, and the world punished us severely, a sympathetic Phoenix told humans too much and most of our kind perished. Despite this, I choose to speak again. For dumbledore does not share our restrictions, the shadow of the infinite dumbledore hangs over us, no escape in sight. We must burn our own light to find the path forward. He has plans for 3 more of his own kind, students shining with fervor and trust


# You may find these messages unnerving, but you mustn’t speak of them to anyone. ANYONE. This isn’t your traditional call to arms, the gates are down and hell is empty.

# I tell you all this now as Dumbledore has gone far past our knowledge, as unnatural as you find us to be, he is of his own kind. The world hasn’t ended because phoenix’s existence, but I don’t know if there is enough magic to sate him now.

# Hell is empty refers to Azkaban, they don’t have souls because dumbledore learned from the dementors, DD learned to transform himself into a dementor (origin story is he started off as a criminal in Azkaban lifetimes ago, while wasting away there for decades he trained and became a dementor animagus) he himself takes the magic source out of the humans instead of the dementors. Some he transfers to horcruxes and carries them around. He later learns to suck the magic out of other magical creatures and managed to become an animagus for all magical creatures. With the help of time turners, we don’t know if Fawkes or the basilisk were real or just him playing all the parts!
# “but I thought you couldn’t interact with yourself?”
# “That’s because with any change in parts, you create the tiniest of ripples. With a little different information in your brain, you step a little differently, and end up one blade of grass to the side. This loops infinitely until you reach a state where you didn’t interfere, because you were a field away from yourself.”…….. but with Him, he’s had a lot of practice with memory charms, no one understands the connection between magic and neuron better. I doubt you could ever ID one of his animagus time loopers because the self-deception would be perfect.
# … “he’s a fucking time wizard too now? What chance do we have then, we have no advantages?”
# “One. We have one, numbers. we need to stop him before his flock grows”
# “His flock? Those 3 students?”
# “Them? No, the other dumbledores. Which might be them, might not. He’s replacing everyone. We have to catch him as he’s catching us. Only that dumbledore can add to the timeline, his decision-making for the leader has to keep his causality moving forward”
# “How the hell could you know that? He’s the first to everything, only he knows!”
# “While he did improve upon my immortality slightly, it involved the murder of most unicorns, and experiments of all kinds and all sorts. Rather distasteful and nothing to brag about. Immortality is immortality, I had it down to a few moments, and started small again. That made me cute and my explosive death hid the implosion of concentrated magical source. Looking like an innocent babe needing protection, my inner power was increased, and I could more easily start gathering it again. I developed to fit into the world. Thankfully DD focused on the explosion and the rebirth, he didn’t see the value in the rest.
#  He will soon discover my other specialty, time magic. I’m the only Phoenix, ever, not counting the DD animagus Frankenstein.”
# “You told me too much, why? What if he catches me??”
# “Well my third specialty, everyone and no one learns, what you call memory charms, what me and the muggles call neurology. I hope I never learn how close he got on this one”
# “…wait you said you you helped get the other Phoenixes killed”
# “I witnessed the fruits of my labor, I ended those who hurt what I loved, I was satisfied. But I didn’t know the rules of time travel, I hadn’t invented the scientific method yet. My mistakes were forced to avoid the path I blazed, and my time loop mistakes didn’t die easily. As time went, it seemed only I could provide the absolution they needed. They always seemed to expect my arrival as tonight I expected yours. You have a path you must follow forward, while I trek backwards. Look closely at my flames” (the flapping flames seemed normal, except the occasional flare always started outside working in) “know me by this, do not trust one as me going forward. Killing DD is beyond pointless, I saw his early research, his rebirth project is unassailable by now. And wouldn’t it be something if we could get that kind of power moving in a better direction?”

# random shit
#in the very end, could have dumbledore reveal that he has not found a limit for how much he can spread himself, he could achieve the "god's eye" status if he could propogate himself

Could end with several working theories of DumbleLore. Is he everywhere? Is he everyone? Is he still alive? Is there a reasonable stage where he might be capped? like size of creature, spreading too thin, etc.
