# lets start painting the overall picture

Scenes:

- Harry training with Snape
- Flashbacks
- Luna storyline

# Dec 24th

In the story of the first time snape met dumbledore, it was watching him save people from grindelwald maybe? Some sort of hero act. Reveal dumbledore hidden intentions later, maybe that time he was net good

The person dumbledore saves invents some new magic, maybe a line of investigation for snape and Harry here? It could put them on the path towards understanding his immortality

Time clones?

Go back in time, have original self wipe new guy memories, and have new guy cast a spell making original guy go into the past so he can become new guy

You don’t know your own worth, you’d intimidate yourself

# Dec 20th- micro black holes == dementors? and voldemort as a hidden successor, a rival dumbledore never intended to have

Micro black holes is how I explain magic, magic is creating a zone like the inside of a black hole, where you open up states of matter that weren’t possible before, performing transformations at a fundamental level, quantum mechanics precisely controlled. My dumbledore was struck my a shooting black hole, a dementor, and understands magic at a base level because of them. Maybe dumbledore, when he reveals himself to Harry, keeps telling Harry lessons through stories about dementors? It could be stories from the perspective of people he personally sucked dry. His dementor impersonation was all he needed it to be, he could appear like one and suck people dry. There’s no way to know what a dementor thinks, whether it savors the souls it sucks, the magical power consumed as it’s produced. Dementors don’t prevent magic, they eat it. But when dumbledore feeds, he takes everything. Memories magically stored away.


The tale of two villains. “Once there was a great wizard, a great scientist and provider of several generations of innovation. They were betrayed by a greedy underling, and grew excessively cautious. He found immortality was quite achievable and set out to destroy all such research. The second villain is the first villain’s top student, who managed to study and achieve immortality before dumbledore even found out. Riddle hides his work well enough, but he really is a problem as Voldemort as well. So by orchestrating the true death of Voldemort, he is fulfilling his base goal of protecting against immortal dictators. You need a guardian, with how dangerous magic is. We just need to renegotiate our position with our guardian. The goal must be to rehabilitate dumbledore, to demand respect and influence. “Because to chase him into a corner would quickly spell doom for us all, the potential depth to his defenses is limitless, and any of us could be a dumbledore, manimagus-transformed and self-memory charmed. Any plan must be okay with dumbledore finding out what we want to do. We don’t want to elicit the riddle reaction, we want a path to peace.


# random

"It all equally seems like magic to you, but Dumbledore has made so many genuine leap innovations, that it is equally magical to us. His quirkiness hides a deep understanding of magic. Most other successful innovators get cushy school jobs where they can experiment more and teach less, DD long ago gave up releasing any info on his personal research. It's like if Einstein refused to release any of his work publicly, instead he went to teach at a university and to slowly parse out his info at different times to different students. Different students end up understanding different concepts, all with incomplete information, using what they have. So much of magic

# Dec 6 notes

There’s kind of a big plan versus details divide in the brain, right brain might be big picture, our consciousness is a mix but often the judgy, analytical mind of left brain dominates, and we lose sight of the big picture

Dolphins also sleep half a brain at a time, Snape studied dolphins

Snape feels rejected by Lily in the end but he doesn’t betray her intentionally. He’s just forced to trust Voldemort since no one else scares dumbledore

# Dec 5 notes- Lily and Snape's conspiracy

The new pair is Harry and Luna, she’s “ditzy”, hard to understand and grew up making up magical monsters and tabloid news. She is the lily equivalent.

Lily was secretly a mind reader, she became friends with snape because he was the only other student she couldn’t read. They had a friendship no one else could hear. A romance. Something no one else knew: she was the best of liars, she never let anyone know, except Snape, who she knew could keep a secret

Lily became alert to dumbledore thanks to her hidden trickiness

Evil guy possessed dumbledore when he was young, after escaping prison. Snape first tells the story of another man.

Later tells the story of how grindelwald and DD broke into a tomb, how DD sacrificed Grundy, only to find out it was DD that was then taken over by the ancient magician. This magician is the death that chased after the 3 brothers. It gave out the 3 gifts because he wanted to help share his knowledge, instead they killed people, stole from people, and clutched to the past. He is going to break the wizarding world’s status quo. His joint at teaching is his last hurrah before tearing it all down, the last chance for todays magicians.

Maybe some emphasis on learning about the young man dumbledore versus the old guy, and the dichotomy of them being in the same body

I want to trace the steps of dumbledores life, snape wants Harry to beat dumbledore at his own game, do something crazy game breaking first

(I kind of want to introduce Lily as something DD couldn't anticipate, someone with a natural talent that he does not share)

# Dec 2 notes

So when snape is training harry, he’s only talking inside Harry’s brain, no external vocalization is safe

“Do you watch a lot of action movies Harry? Well sometimes you have to tell someone something shocking, and they have to pretend like nothing happened. If you can’t do that, it isn’t safe for you to leave this room”

…(memory charms)


DD, other accomplices? Opposing seeker who was the best in the school until Harry made him irrelevant. Other students or people Harry doesn’t know or who could be accidentally alone in a secured room without Harry raising suspicion? Like maybe Snape keeps casting love spells on Harry so he takes them to the room of requirements, one of Harry’s requirements is no one finds out what happens inside. There he could be having the same conversations that Snape was having with Harry. It would probably be more like Snape controlling Harry, so he could do the legimency himself and keep Harry in secret. Or Harry would have his brain connected, but then would magically separate the two parts, whenever anyone else was around. He would appear ditsy with a sudden loss of memory, but would react perfectly in character, the brain visible to any prying would reveal an honest man. *****The spell also serves as the ultimate warning for anyone observing Harry, as he could only plan and work with the other half of his brain if he was alone. It’s the only way Snape believes anyone could ever fool dumbledore, the direct act is impossible or at least improbable, and a Harry will be spending way too much time with the best mind reader alive.

(Dumbledore wanted riddle dead after he realized riddle had secretly achieved immortality when no one was looking. He had made like 7 by the time DD even confirmed one. That infuriated and scared him. DD is immortal and can be reborn, but he still bleeds, his hands still die from simple traps). Riddle hid in the darkness, dark marks ensuring loyalty. He played the villain to the fullest, dragged out a war. All to stay out of DD’s grasp. DD never defeated Voldemort himself, but he did set up the events to ensure all his horcruxes were killed before riddle knew it. What DD didn’t know was that riddle and found and fostered an occlumency genius in Severus Snape, and passed on most of his knowledge through magical transfer. All of the information make like very cynical for Snape, he magically hallucinates riddle sometimes, all the information in his brain forms its own form of consciousness, it is responsive, honest and works like the concierge to the information that they have. Because Snape is always hiding from dumbledore, is it because he is using occlumency very well, or is it because he has the split brain spell cast on himself all the time? As a double agent, Snape might take the most extreme measure. Snape would never tell anyone, he would most likely have several layers of safety

# Dec 1

First conversation with Snape have to be wiped from Harry's mind, stored away by Snape and protected. As he practices occlumency, Snape unabashedly attacks Harry each time, prying through memories, judging if he could live up to the prophecy. Each time, Snape steals away Harry's memory of the meeting. From Harry's perspective, he just passed out after his occlumency was overwhelmed, no memory of what happend. All because the most dangerous wizard on the planet is his Headmaster, Dumbledore. Dumbeldore is possibly older than Merlin, maybe was Merlin, and has been accumulating knowledge for centuries. He's endorsed and controlled magic for a large chunk of that time, in various names and forms. For the past 150* years, for all of the life of this current Dumbledore,

(DumbleDore might especially hate Voldy because he could follow in his footsteps with immortality? Immortality jealousy? In a backstory, it shows DD meeting an immortal and learning from them. Either he kills them in jealousy or he witnesses their death, or he respects their pursuit. Maybe DD just finds Riddle's methods dirty, and must act the role of hero. DD loves the conflict Riddle brings, he loves being outwitted by his student, even if he knows he cannot be actually killed. It's a love-hate relationship. DD improves his own techniques by infusing his Phoenix techniques into the Horcrux technology and spells that Riddle made. In this conflict, DD is able to put new students through the grinder, force them to invent new magic and spells for DD to adopt for himself. The voldemort that you saw, with the gross face? That wasn't Tom Riddle, at least not a proper one. What you saw was a Dumbledore clone or copy of himself made through a time-turner, transformed the same way a skilled wizard can learn to transform into a cat. That was his first ungodly power, most likely. There was once a tyrant (make role smaller) that ruled with personal magical prowess alone, brute force. One day, a trained wizard-warrior came along and bound the tyrant. He took him away to the magical prison. In there, the tyrant observed and learned, his innate magical talent always drove him to find a fight. He was raised a warrior, and promised war. He believed he could fight anything, and this prison was just the latest battlefield. The dementors humbled him for a while, but then he began to realize the lunacy of this prison operation. They have all the most dangerous wizards hanging out with some of the most dangerous creatures. The guards can ward them away, but herding and setting out a bird feeder aren't real control. DD became like a bird watcher but with dementors. He had personal encounters with dementors, his ability to cast spells without speaking and without a wand kept him safe from the dementor's kiss (he had a patronus on-feinting spell?). But he touched them, lived with them. Until like an animagus, he could become a dementor himself.)

(It was no accident Snape killed dumbledore! He knew DD would live and even talked to him via the portrait later, his one of many forms, this one magically and psychly linked to others. DD even portrayed my great, yet futile murder as something HE WANTED. I knew this was just one head of the Hydra, and I knew Dumbledore only ever truly feared one other. Tom Riddle, the orphan genius. DD made sure Riddle never got caught, he was still perfecting his horcrux technique, he needed more experience, a helpful hint here or there passed through unknowing other professors like Slughorn. DD used Slughorn more than once, that one horcrux clip is the one bit that slipt through the memory wipes, left there as blackmail against Slughorn).

(Do I have Tom Riddle and DD be lovers or is that too much for my fan fic? DD feels a lot of afinity for Tom, gifted and troubled, in pursuit and capable of achieving immortality.)

# Dumbledore, one character realizes they know more than they should, realize they are a dumbledore and that’s how they catch one

#=================================================================================

#11-27
# Snape starts the HP fan fiction, he is teaching Harry or someone else to protect their mind, snape reveals that there is a level dumbledore never reached, he always sought power and once DD’s mind was perfectly protected, he moved on to something new. Through meditation and therapy, snape discovered another level but told no one. He had an ego death experience and had a long conversation with lily via the stone. She’s the one that warns him of DD’s true nature, something she stumbled upon, DD hinted at it in his attempts to win her over. There are other wizards that know, most are far away for safety’s sake since no one knows DD’s limits.

"I can tell you more, but only in bits. You are clearly a natural at Occlumism or whatever, but you're in too deep with Dumbledore. You need to forget what you know, to maintain a perfectly ignorant version of yourself. So I'm going to temporarily pause communication between the hemispheres of your brain. Since you are the talker, we are gonna cover you up nice and good (sweet mask that puts half of someones head in a soundproof box)."

"Couldn't we just use memory charms?"

"I can do that on myself, but I can't imitate your brain like that. Cedric used memory charms, he was brilliant. DD's favorite at the time, though he'd obviously been grooming you for awhile. Watching you two compete drew DD's full attention. Moaning Myrtle, any of the other ghosts, a fly on the wall, a classmate or a professor. Dumbledore could have been any of them, all of them close enough to notice a sign of self-administered memory charms. When you show DD that you are playing this game on 'the next level', DD ups his level as well, no mercy. DD loves to keep the story going though, and hoped to find some collaborators, so he waited and took care of Cedric in the graveyard. You're going to be alone with him, one mistake and he makes you into a toy.

So for this method, you will unconsciously know things. If your left hand appears to be giving you a hint, follow it."

"Wait if it is the brains of the mission then what does that make me?"
"The perfect liar. You will make up explanations out of thin air and believe them instantly"
# Cedric was Snape’s first student for the mission.

# They can’t kill him, their plan rests on capture, preferably stuck as a newt, occasionally transformed into something that can communicate

# Have it start with the student talking about zen or brain science or both, then have snape talk to them about cutting brain down the middle with a spell that you can remove later, making you separate consciousnesses for a while

# Snape found this because he was given a dangerous procedure like zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, he discovers a way to undo it with magic, for his student he does the opposite

# A key for snape is he uses magic to be able to bridge the psychic gap, he is essentially using psychic magic to communicate between the two parts

# Snape keeps telling stories about himself or dumbledore

# Dumbledore could have one side that is nice, they gotta figure out how to imprison the evil side


# Snape’s strength is DD’s weakness
#=================================================================================
#=================================================================================

# 11-15
# My dumbledore has the horcruxes of several immortal wizards and uses them to control the wizards. They cannot expose him and cannot betray him. Some dark lords, some good ones, both out of public eye because of him. He made grindelwald commit the crimes so he could be the hero. He takes the horcruxes everywhere so the wizards are like his secret friends. The ones like grindelwald hold most of his mind, his body in Azkaban is nearly empty

# The fiery bird of life and death has a complicated history in magic, most of the old stories were smoothed out by Dumbledore, until today, and now we call them the magical embodiment of all that is good. Few recall the days of the Phoenix hunts, even fewer the reason why they were hunted. The spoils were beyond compare, but that’s not all that immortal beings bring. They are supremely intelligent and immortal, everyone still agrees on that. But they somehow believe Phoenix’s don’t care, don’t love, don’t hate those who destroy what they love. People today don’t even believe these higher beings can understand human language. The flames of fire warm and burn, and so do those of the Phoenix. But the Phoenix has no obvious fuel source, oxygen is unaffected. But magic isn’t. That’s why Phoenix’s are always found in the company of powerful mages, it was originally a formal contract. But smarter than magicians, they soon found they could get a much better deal without the contract. In exchange for the occasional help, a firebird could befriend a powerful mage in the prime of their development. Unaware of the absurd potential within themselves, these special mages never notice as 30% of their full magic is siphoned off. An emotional attachment was found to be particularly effective, if a Phoenix “dies” next to their partner, the rush of that 30% returning is associated with how much they love us. We can use our own magic for rebirth, though it takes a lot, we lose most of what we worked so hard to gather. But death is so emotional for you, even if it’s not real for us. And in that moment, in your fight among men, you give us a bit of your “soul”, your root magic source. That 30% potential that has been streaming into our blazing wings, we take it all, it’s future as well, into our next life. All the built up magic we save makes us that much stronger, a positive feedback loop that’s been going on for millennia. We grew greedy once, and the world punished us severely, a sympathetic Phoenix told humans too much and most of our kind perished. Despite this, I choose to speak again. For dumbledore does not share our restrictions, the shadow of the infinite dumbledore hangs over us, no escape in sight. We must burn our own light to find the path forward. He has plans for 3 more of his own kind, students shining with fervor and trust


# You may find these messages unnerving, but you mustn’t speak of them to anyone. ANYONE. This isn’t your traditional call to arms, the gates are down and hell is empty.

# I tell you all this now as Dumbledore has gone far past our knowledge, as unnatural as you find us to be, he is of his own kind. The world hasn’t ended because phoenix’s existence, but I don’t know if there is enough magic to sate him now.

# Hell is empty refers to Azkaban, they don’t have souls because dumbledore learned from the dementors, DD learned to transform himself into a dementor (origin story is he started off as a criminal in Azkaban lifetimes ago, while wasting away there for decades he trained and became a dementor animagus) he himself takes the magic source out of the humans instead of the dementors. Some he transfers to horcruxes and carries them around. He later learns to suck the magic out of other magical creatures and managed to become an animagus for all magical creatures. With the help of time turners, we don’t know if Fawkes or the basilisk were real or just him playing all the parts!
# “but I thought you couldn’t interact with yourself?”
# “That’s because with any change in parts, you create the tiniest of ripples. With a little different information in your brain, you step a little differently, and end up one blade of grass to the side. This loops infinitely until you reach a state where you didn’t interfere, because you were a field away from yourself.”…….. but with Him, he’s had a lot of practice with memory charms, no one understands the connection between magic and neuron better. I doubt you could ever ID one of his animagus time loopers because the self-deception would be perfect.
# … “he’s a fucking time wizard too now? What chance do we have then, we have no advantages?”
# “One. We have one, numbers. we need to stop him before his flock grows”
# “His flock? Those 3 students?”
# “Them? No, the other dumbledores. Which might be them, might not. He’s replacing everyone. We have to catch him as he’s catching us. Only that dumbledore can add to the timeline, his decision-making for the leader has to keep his causality moving forward”
# “How the hell could you know that? He’s the first to everything, only he knows!”
# “While he did improve upon my immortality slightly, it involved the murder of most unicorns, and experiments of all kinds and all sorts. Rather distasteful and nothing to brag about. Immortality is immortality, I had it down to a few moments, and started small again. That made me cute and my explosive death hid the implosion of concentrated magical source. Looking like an innocent babe needing protection, my inner power was increased, and I could more easily start gathering it again. I developed to fit into the world. Thankfully DD focused on the explosion and the rebirth, he didn’t see the value in the rest.
#  He will soon discover my other specialty, time magic. I’m the only Phoenix, ever, not counting the DD animagus Frankenstein.”
# “You told me too much, why? What if he catches me??”
# “Well my third specialty, everyone and no one learns, what you call memory charms, what me and the muggles call neurology. I hope I never learn how close he got on this one”
# “…wait you said you you helped get the other Phoenixes killed”
# “I witnessed the fruits of my labor, I ended those who hurt what I loved, I was satisfied. But I didn’t know the rules of time travel, I hadn’t invented the scientific method yet. My mistakes were forced to avoid the path I blazed, and my time loop mistakes didn’t die easily. As time went, it seemed only I could provide the absolution they needed. They always seemed to expect my arrival as tonight I expected yours. You have a path you must follow forward, while I trek backwards. Look closely at my flames” (the flapping flames seemed normal, except the occasional flare always started outside working in) “know me by this, do not trust one as me going forward. Killing DD is beyond pointless, I saw his early research, his rebirth project is unassailable by now. And wouldn’t it be something if we could get that kind of power moving in a better direction?”

# random shit
#in the very end, could have dumbledore reveal that he has not found a limit for how much he can spread himself, he could achieve the "god's eye" status if he could propogate himself

Could end with several working theories of DumbleLore. Is he everywhere? Is he everyone? Is he still alive? Is there a reasonable stage where he might be capped? like size of creature, spreading too thin, etc.
