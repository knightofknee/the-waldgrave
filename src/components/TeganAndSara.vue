      The above video explains the concept of another "you" inside of your brain. I've long liked the concept of thinking of love songs as one part of myself singing to me (I am also working on a psychological thriller based on the 'you is two' concept). If you are single, this trick can turn potentially sad songs into introspective ballads. It doesn't work all of the time, but it really seemed like some artists write to this style. Carly Rae Jepsen is great material for this, her use of neutral pronouns and lyrical style promotes it well. I was actually going to write about her album "Dedicated", with the song below lining up with the 'you is two' concept. This song would be the scene where the right brain, after trying to speak out through the use of music, after being just a witness for the most part, takes control and sings, but is also renouncing their temporary control of the 'words' in exchance for more control over the sound, or more control over HOW the individual goes about their life, while letting them choose the WHAT or figure out the WHY on their own later.

      At this time, I was listening to 'Hey I'm Just like You' on repeat often, and after I heard a lyric in this light, I couldn't not hear it. Maybe parts of this are obvious, but I argue that every character in this album is a different part of the same person, the person singing and the audience. To demonstrate, I will break down the key lyrics from each song below. One important item to note is the nature of this album. Tegan and Sara took material from their high school days and made music with the help of that. They wrote this album right as they were approaching the age of 40. Turning 30 soon myself, I vibe with the material. They are talking about how to grow with yourself, a midlife crisis of sorts, from the persective of a high schooler and a 40-year old simultaneously, making it a timeless discussion of growth.

      The core concept of this song confused me but it starts with brain concept (also found in The Fall) that the "we" we most associate with is a stream of consciousness. Not a single unbroken thought, but the cumulative thoughts that you pile up while awake. That is the immediate "you". This song is taking comfort in the temporary nature of feelings, that even if you feel bad now, another "you" will have a slightly different slate that they work with, and it isn't "your" problem now. If you hold your breath as long as you can, you pass out, lose consciousness, and other parts of your brain take over. When you "wake up", your brain has already been changed directly as it edits things during sleep.
