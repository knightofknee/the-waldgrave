  <h2>Chicago Initiatives- order is not prioritized</h2>
  <p>
    Carbon Check- it's like a carbon tax but it isn't a tax because the government gets nothing. We check how much harm people are putting in the air and we charge them. That money goes to a fund, and every month that fund is divided evenly between every citizen. Everyone bears the consequences of these actions, so everyone should be paid to compensate. This can immediately correct incentives without any other political bullshit.
  </p>
  <h2>Chicago priorities</h2>
  <p>
    First is security. I propose that we do all we can to make our city safe, while protecting our privacy and civil rights through clear processes with audit trails. I want cameras on every city street, with the footage only being accessible for violent crimes and all searches are recorded. Everything goes through general machine learning, but any viewing of footage has to be sanctioned. Any additional use of the cameras beyond violent crime would require a city vote. My other security element is universal basic income. We can set up a UBI program with what we have, limited in count or amount or both, and set it up so that if you later have an income above x% of the poverty line, y% of your additional income goes to the UBI fund. The tax drastically lowers when the UBI fund is growing (it keeps growing so that one day it won't need the tax). Alongside the street cameras, I want all cop cameras linked live whenever they are active. This footage will be fed to the police and other help teams. The footage will be fed into machine learning and any escalated scenarios will be highlighted. For every cop, there is a live support line. They hit a button or say the right thing, they can raise their status themselves as well. They are then connected to the best available support staff who see and hear the situation live. This goes beyond accountability, failure is failure. This establishes clear perfomance: the officers do their job normally following basic procedure with cameras on at all times, and then in escalated scenarios the responsibility falls first on the police support team giving orders based on all information at hand. The rest of the responsibility falls on the watchers. This group oversees and audits the cam footage alongside the supporting communication of the police. They hear and see everything because they are part of the same general support team. The goal of this setup is to reduce the obvious risk of individual police officers being unprepared for escalated situations by prioritizing supporting them by using tech to bring the experience of the veteran officers to the ear of every officer. Hard decisions are made, and this will give a space for criticizing choices as they are being made. Alternatives from other groups like mental health support can be brought in quickly. We ask officers to do too much with too little support. This would make new officers' lives much better while providing accountability, and we need a lot of new officers now.

    Second is education, the 2 priorities I see are providing the best possible support for new teachers, and having the best teachers teach the other teachers (they can still teach students directly or not). But I think the ROI of helping our teachers is immense. For every level and every class in the CPS, we should have all possible materials prepared for new teachers. New teachers should be given every advantage and should have experienced teachers alongside them. I want Chicago to be the top destination for new teachers. And with the UBI plan, I want to enable anyone of any income or age to become a student again if they want.

    Third is transportation. Immediately we need to hire more drivers for the CTA, there is no 'driver shortage', they just aren't willing to pay enough. The value is there though, just one driver provides so much potential value. No more ads on train info signs, a number and a color tells you how many minutes until the next train for that color's line. Yet they block out the whole sign for fucking ads. The paper schedule doesn't have that shit. I want some north/south and east/west streets converted to just bike lanes, while others then say or recommend no bikes in the street. I want new trains, high speed rail to O'hare and Midway. These programs could be funded in a structure where the investors are initially involved, but they have a cap, so they could charge whatever they want, but after making enough money, they would no longer be involved. It's like a loan, except the payments are linked to the success of the train. Profits from these lines will then turn towards funding other lines.

    I want something like you get an ownership stake until you have made a certain return on your investment, a max return -->
  </p>
  <h3>Short term plans for Chicago</h3>
  <p>
    All El signs will ALWAYS show the next incoming trains for each line they are serving. No notices or ads blocking the whole screen. All you need is a color and a number(minutes), there should always be space for them. This would be a great starting project for moving everything possible to an open source format.
  </p>
  <p>
    Concrete-protected bike lane highways north-south and east-west. Track bike crashes and build more protected bike lanes wherever they seem needed. Map out the active cycling population of Chicago so we can get accurate simulations going and can optimize the bike lane making.
  </p>
  <p>
    Set up a new independent process for review of police conduct and in exchange raise police wages to incentivize the new additions to the force that we need.
  </p>
  <p>
    Force Bears to stay and build a bigger stadium in the same area, give them any land they need and let them pay for and own the stadium. For however much the city gives up in the deal, the city gains part ownership of the Bears. So for every dollar in profit the Bears take home, the city would get a percentage. If they leave, get the Jaguars here, the McCaskeys could clearly use some competition. The Bears go backwards and match the Cubs on the north side, the Jags join the Socks as the real team of the city (sorry I'm not sorry, they decided to stop competing, that isn't very Chicago of them).
  </p>
  <p>
    Fred Hampton statue, somewhere prominent in the city. A plaque explaining how he was assassinated by the Chicago police, in a planned murder that included the FBI giving the police a detailed floor plan indicating where Fred Hampton slept. He was the potentially the best leader we have had, and the city has let his memory go improperly marked. Despite having murdered the man, the police abuse of Fred Hampton didn't stop there, the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago helped block the renaming of a street after him. Not some bold change like renaming lakeshore drive, just one of the brown signs under the regular street signs. We have over a thousand of them, most go unchallenged, and most are not as deserving. They murdered him and his legacy, to let this injustice stand robs the city of a role model as well. Is there anything worse in this city's history that I should know of?
  </p>
  <p>
    Violence in the city: the new police oversight system paired with the increased budget we need to hire and keep a competent police force will give us some basic tools we need. The real wins will come from building up. The education system needs an overhaul, new teachers need a support system to help them flourish where they are now suffering. Singapore has many best practices to learn from. New teachers should be taught by successful teachers who now focus on teaching teachers. Another big win comes in the form of Universal Basic Income, establishing a minimum income floor for all residents. I want all residents of Chicago to have access to a roof and a floor. This should provide means and hope to the kids out there currently mired by all this violence. This can start small, and as the budget gets balanced and we can afford it, it will rise. Imagine if a family member of yours found themselves homeless, or infirmed and in medical debt? I'd feel much better if I knew they had the simple bear necessities. Chicago is my family, I believe that together we can support our most vulnerable.

  <h3>Long term plan for Chicago and Illinois</h3>
  <p>
    Universal basic income will not only support our most vulnerable neighbors, it will enable many people to take time to not only find a better job, but to pursue their own passions, whatever they may be. It sets a financial goal we want to reach, where the government financial holes are finally cauterized, and we start to get a tax surplus. Once we get a surplus, we shouldn't be taxing as much because the bill is paid. When we reach that point, additional income should be rewarded with a lower income tax that goes into the BE FUNd. The BE fund is set aside to grow until the gains in the BE fund are enough to fund the government, state and city taxes gone. The BE fund wants to give everyone the gift to be whoever they want to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    To reach this lofty goal, the BE Fund starts small and grows alongside our ability to fund it. We want to tax the 1% to get this done, but we should provide incentive for them to stay, to come here. The pension problem should be understood as the government promising money that they didn't have, instead of just paying people. If you want to help someone for their future retirement in particular, buy an annuity for them. We need to stop the losses and put ourselves on a path of recovery. The UBI would start small in disadvantaged neighborhoods and then expand. After an agreed upon UBI level is reached, and other projects are funded, then taxes should be progressively decreased on everyone. It is important to note that the Universal Income Floor would be slowly built up.
  </p>
    <p>The initial 'Open Chicago' idea is that we have a coding competition, any open source project that benefits the city in any way. Ideally, there is a prize and the top project is also sanctioned by the city. No matter what the city does, I will promote it. We should make it easy for people to make free contributions to their city. The whole premise of open source should be perfect for the city of Chicago. It's free labor (the city is broke), the change process is transparent (the city is corrupt/incompetent, take your pick), but the people of the city are great (and we want to empower them).</p>
    <p>
      A later goal would be to make a leaderboard for contributions to the city, could have a line count board, and another board based on some sort of review tool that takes out line count inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A later, later goal is to take the github/open source approach to other parts of the functioning of the city. Every part of how the city works can be put there. Each step like it is a software function. Then people can post their complaints about how a particular process is broken, and they can even post solutions then. Those solutions are reviewed by the community on the same platforms like github, in the same way. As it develops, you can add rules for when the city must accept the change or respond with their disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another project I want to build is called the More Perfect Platform. It will be a tool for me to present my own political platform, but more importantly, I want to make it for others to use as well. The idea can be summed up as a subreddit mixed with github with a more complicated comment system. It should make it easy for people to compare platforms side-by-side on specific topics. I'd also want to give the candidates a place to debate in long-form, so it's not the live bullshit of tv debates but still has a strong moderator in two forms, the first is the different logic fields that are required, like "what is the top opposition view to your current view"? (if they have a named opponent, that opponent gets a spot to post their view on the issue (character restricted (1000?) with link to more)). The other moderator is the general public upvoting, downvoting and commenting. Users get a score based on their response rate to questions with sufficient upvotes. The responses are also scored based on general user feedback. Instead of the normal up/down vote for those, the buttons are "answered the question clearly", "avoided the question", and "gave a partial answer". The main goal here is to lay out views clearly and enable direct democracy as best we can with the tools at hand. You will be able to use a drivers license to verify that you are a resident of the city or state, and your vote will go towards the score that shows first, the verified Resident voters. For active politicans, this should be the most useful aspect. We will have residents filtering the requests and opinions of residents, the non-tech equivalent is hard to imagine, a mob of millions of people sorting the opinions of millions simultaneously. Direct democracy has never been more feasible, it's about time we started developing appropriate tools in earnest. 'Who wants to be a Millionaire?' and their ask the audience button, or a reality tv show vote is all I've seen so far.
