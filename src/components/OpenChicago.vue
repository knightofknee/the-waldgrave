  <h3>Short term plans for Chicago</h3>

    All El signs will ALWAYS show the next incoming trains for each line they are serving.

  <p>
    Concrete-protected bike lane highways north-south and east-west.

  <p>
    Set up a new independent process for review of police conduct and in exchange raise police wages to incentivize the new additions to the force that we need.
  </p>

    Force Bears to stay and build a bigger stadium in the same area, give them any land they need and let them pay for and own the stadium. For however much the city gives up in the deal, the city gains part ownership of the Bears. So for every dollar in profit the Bears take home, the city would get a percentage.

    Fred Hampton statue, somewhere prominent in the city.

  <h3>Long term plan for Chicago and Illinois</h3>
  <p>
    Universal basic income will not only support our most vulnerable neighbors, it will enable many people to take time to not only find a better job, but to pursue their own passions, whatever they may be. It sets a financial goal we want to reach, where the government financial holes are finally cauterized, and we start to get a tax surplus. Once we get a surplus, we shouldn't be taxing as much because the bill is paid. When we reach that point, additional income should be rewarded with a lower income tax that goes into the BE FUNd. The BE fund is set aside to grow until the gains in the BE fund are enough to fund the government, state and city taxes gone. The BE fund wants to give everyone the gift to be whoever they want to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    To reach this lofty goal, the BE Fund starts small and grows alongside our ability to fund it. We want to tax the 1% to get this done, but we should provide incentive for them to stay, to come here. The pension problem should be understood as the government promising money that they didn't have, instead of just paying people. If you want to help someone for their future retirement in particular, buy an annuity for them. We need to stop the losses and put ourselves on a path of recovery. The UBI would start small in disadvantaged neighborhoods and then expand. After an agreed upon UBI level is reached, and other projects are funded, then taxes should be progressively decreased on everyone.
  </p>
    <p>The initial idea is that we have a coding competition, any open source project that benefits the city in any way. Ideally, there is a prize and the top project is also sanctioned by the city. No matter what the city does, I will promote it. We should make it easy for people to make free contributions to their city. The whole premise of open source should be perfect for the city of Chicago. It's free labor (the city is broke), the change process is transparent (the city is corrupt/incompetent, take your pick), but the people of the city are great (and we want to empower them).</p>
    <p>
      A later goal would be to make a leaderboard for contributions to the city, could have a line count board, and another board based on some sort of review tool that takes out line count inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A later, later goal is to take the github/open source approach to other parts of the functioning of the city. Every part of how the city works can be put there. Each step like it is a software function. Then people can post their complaints about how a particular process is broken, and they can even post solutions then. Those solutions are reviewed by the community on the same platforms like github, in the same way. As it develops, you can add rules for when the city must accept the change or respond with their disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another project I want to build is called the More Perfect Platform. It will be a tool for me to present my own political platform, but more importantly, I want to make it for others to use as well. The idea can be summed up as a subreddit mixed with github with a more complicated comment system. It should make it easy for people to compare platforms side-by-side on specific topics. I'd also want to give the candidates a place to debate in long-form, so it's not the live bullshit of tv debates but still has a strong moderator.
