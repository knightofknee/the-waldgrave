    GolfGolf mini-golf. All about the golf, profit capped at 1% or something. Over is used to cover costs of upgrades and to lower future prices. Every hole is a banger, both a unique golf challenge and unique theme. Black curtains between. It is byob and has a bar with at-cost+1$ beers and wine. Bartender can charge whatever they want for other things. Every hole has a target you can hit that gives you -1, making a perfect score near impossible. Highest level of investment: you never really wait because you spend set time on holes just watching what happens while you are there. Someone could be changing the hole while you are on it, like a an avalanche or slowly cracking ice. Wait times can also be reduced because you don't know your next hole until you finish your current one. This is so that you can be moved around a slow group and then go back to that hole later. Utilization is maxed and wait time is minimized. Also we can anticipate slowdowns and time out little mini art events. Profit is capped but costs are not. The art staff can choose whatever they find best and push barriers. They are golfgolf's core, the creators. (We could have a burlesque night where dancers dance among the holes, both fun and edgy for publicity).
