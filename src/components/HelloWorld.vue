    <h2>2023 Update 8)</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        In 2022 I focused on improving my habits and designing them around my knowledge of neuroscience and psychology. I started the year targeting 7 daily habits (including this website I'm up to 8). My concept is I want to fill my day up with the things I want to do long term. I am also working on a vice tracking model, but I've been primarily concerned with filling time with positive actions. Here is where they stand:
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditation is my biggest success so far. I had a 10 minute daily practice going at the beginning of the year. At the end of May I bumped it up to 20 minutes. On June 19th, I read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5261734/">a neuroscience study</a> of people who have meditated over 10,000 hours. Their brain scans show unique activity, constant gamma brain wave activity (the fastest type of brain wave), and improvement in areas like empathy, which is supercharged. Basically, Nirvana is real, so since then I've been meditating an hour a day so I can reach Nirvana sometime before 2050.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walking. I was ahead of my goal of 10,000 steps/day until the December cold and the holiday parties left me short. That is a win for me, my goal in walking tracking is to make sure I am hitting a minimum level of activity every day. In 2023, I want to keep up that minimum without caring about the number of steps listed in my phone. I spent too much time caring about it. I want to take at least one walk a day and only check my steps to see if I am below 6,000 for the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading. I've done a lot here but have far to go. I've been somewhat consistent, I made steady progress on my neuroscience book. For that, I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and aim for reading at least 2 pages. I scatter books around my house but still reach for my computer too often. I've begun making it a bedtime routine with some success (only fun books at night). My highlights for the year are the first Wheel of Time book, and Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver (it takes place during the Glorious Revolution and it is oddly accurate, what a weird time).
      </p>
      <p>
        Yoga. I had some strong yoga runs, on the year I think I hit over 50% of days? I'll need my app to calculate that for me. I feel strong here, I am still getting a lot out of my 10-18 minute routine. I'm going gradually deeper into my stretches, so I feel great about where I am at with this one. Daily yoga makes such a massive difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exercise. My performance here has been pretty weak overall, but strong at times. I had some stretches of strong cardio work when it was warm, and I have a jump rope and row machine now to help me in the winter. I'm optimistic about the jump rope, and am slowly getting used to it. At the end of the year I started doing my weighted pullups routine again, I am hoping to actually get into lifting this year. At the end of 2023, I want to be doing 50 pullups with 50 pounds of weight at least once a week. (Currenly I am at 32 pounds and manage 25 with, 25 without).
      </p>
      <p>
        Creative Writing. I've been very consistent with this, any notes I take in my phone count. But I haven't gone deep at all. I have exercises to try out. This year I want to try writing longer things, like screenwriting or longer versions of my sci fi or fan fic ideas. I want to start holding regular rap camps, which will just be some friends coming over for brunch alongside trying out group writing exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music. This has mostly been piano for me, along with some singing and rap practice. I'll do 10-15 minutes of exercies then go through my piano book. After that I love to freestyle, slamming the keys. In 2023 I'm trying out recording myself more often. The inspiration is that when I rap freestyle, there is the desire to write down any banger lines, but that interrupts the flow. So now I occasionally turn on my mic and record the piano as well. It's been weird so far but it's helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working on the Waldgrave. So editing this site mainly. I've been focused on creating content, not showing it. So this year I hope to clean up the site so it can properly host the content I will be publishing. This is by far my least consistent item.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a weekly habit that I have neglected called 'Monday Night Review'. Here I look at all notes of the past week and select the ones that seem interesting. Before I have elaborated on those ideas or shared them with a friend. I am considering doing it as a youtube series and including them here.

    <h2>Wacky Wednesday FAQ</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>Why is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>Open creativity needs you to create an open space for it. And it is a fun way to hang out with friends and talk. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>How is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>Through creativity, weird and effort. Creativity comes easy when you put in the Effort to set up an environment where you can comfortably be Weird</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Who is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>You, or You and your friends, or You and some potential new friends</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>What is a Wacky Wednesday</h4>
        <p>It is an event in which you and any number of friends gather together for some creativity and socializing. I recommend some open art and/or music time as a base, ideally with a creative event of any sort. The event can be whatever, some past examples include an improv excercises, painting, song writing and karaoke. Anything that involves creativity or learning works. Besides that, the only other major element is creating a space where everyone involved feels as comfortable as possible to create and share with no judgement. Improv group exercises can be a great first or second Wacky Wednesday to help the group get in the "yes and..." mindset. Process over product, the goal is to give everyone space to explore.</p>

      <h2>What is the Waldgrave?</h2>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: start; text-align: left;">

          2) The area in your brain where the different forms of consciousness meet. Your understanding how to manage your own waldgrave determines which of your selves tend to get expressed.
        </div>
        <div class="defList">
          3) When you listen to someone talk, their words shape your neurons. A form of them exists in you. On the larger scale, we are a gigabrain. You have ~86 billion neurons, the gigabrain has 8 billion of us.
        </div>
        <div class="defList">
          4) The Waldgrave stands for giving all 8 billion brains the ability to thrive. I believe we can do that through BUBI, and our projects to get there aim to operate with an at-cost or less pricing model. Science and technology can transform the world, but big tech got greedy so now they need me, the name's B and I make tech freely, I'm a rapper in training, RIT's me.

          My latest conscousness theory is that our brains are inherently a product of the past, shaped by a mix of your inner thoughts, outer stimuli and how you reacted to them, along with much chaos. You are the active processes in the brain. You didn't shape it, but you travel within it and choose which paths to take. Your actions further shape it for your future self. Habits form grooves, much wider paths. As you bounce around your brain, it is hard to avoid your natural habits, they are the easier paths. You have to work harder to do something new. This is something to both weaponize and fight against, as you shape your habits to better serve you, and to create a better brain to live in.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          On the cosmic level, we are insignificant and might not even have free will, so why should we spend so much time with judgements? I think the universe is a good thing, and we are a part of it. We are basically patterns, we can lean into the rest of the universe or pull back, and we can choose to observe more or less. We can learn from those interactions, but I don't see the need to judge a part of the universe for being how it is, even if that part is part of me. This brings us to the individual level. People exist on top of a collection of waves, constantly riding ups and downs. But we only observe people at one point at a time. This creates a perception issue, especially for people you don't know. Living in a city, the effect is heightened. If you are around a lot of people, it is expected that you will pass by people at the bottom or top of their waves regularly. If a good driver makes a small mistake once every 100 trips, but you are driving past 400 cars a day, expect to see at least 4 small mistakes. Everyone is driving a different spaceship through the same spacetime, yours accelerates at a different speed than mine, so it may seem like I am intentionally going slow when in reality I am going full speed. Or my ship has had several flat tires thanks to the potholes in my neighborhood, so I'm a little more anxious driving around them than you. Everyone has ups and downs because that's the very nature of our universe, matter and existence is based on ripples. To promote existence as we know it, we want to push up the wavefunctions of others. To do that, we need to understand their waves, their magnitude, frequency, and where they are at right now. Getting in-sync is more important than it may initially seem, in our universe if you have two waves of equal magnitude and frequency destructively interfering (hitting each other when one is high and the other is low), they cancel each other out and both waves disappear. So if you are able to get on the same page as someone, you can boost their upswings and help temper their downswings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, you are a biological computer that is constantly re-programming itself based on neural paths taken. We have limited processing power that we manage, 'we' are not the full brain, we are a part at the top front that connects to the rest, and seems to make decisions. How we think actively shapes our brains, the repeated surges through neurons are like the strings vibrating to create the base waves of our universe. 86 billion little splashes shape the seas of your mind. Meditation has you focus on a background wave that is always there, the in and out flow of your breath. As a new thought rises out of an inner wave peaking, you acknowledge it, understand where it came from, and let it go. You find its amplitude and frequency, get in sync with it, and hug it away with some deconstructive acceptance. You accept that your brain is a product of the past so this thought is a reaction you cannot control. What you can control is your reaction to your brain's default reaction, and in meditation your reaction is to focus back on your breath. But outside of meditation, this enables you to react to your immediate reactions and evaluate the output of your brain, which in turn shapes your brain for the next time. This is where I think conscousness and free will live. Through this, I believe meditation enables you to be more intentionally you.
