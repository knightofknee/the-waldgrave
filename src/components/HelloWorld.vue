    <h2>Goals</h2>
        <!-- We are creatures of creation and expression, but our everyday
          lives do not always give us outlets, so we must create spaces that do.
          The Waldgrave aims to provide the tools to create those spaces for you and your friends,
          and to promote the creation and capture of ideas. -->
    <div>
        <p>We are the tiny aliens in Men in Black who run around inside the heads of human robots. The Waldgrave aims to create spaces where you can comfortably and safely exit your robot for a bit with your alien friends. Current projects and goals of the Waldgrave include <router-link to="/teganandsara"> a music blog</router-link>, <router-link to="/readtogether">a bookclub app</router-link>, <router-link to="/brainstree"> a notes app</router-link>, <router-link to="/openchicago"> Open Chicago</router-link>, <router-link to="/fixingsocialsecurity">fixing social security</router-link>, reducing income equality, <router-link to="/climatechangestrats">combatting climate change</router-link> and <router-link to="/endoftheuniverse">how to (get to and) survive the heat death of the universe</router-link>

    <h2>Wacky Wednesday FAQ</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>Why is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>Open creativity needs you to create an open space for it. And it is a fun way to hang out with friends and talk. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>How is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>Through creativity, weird and effort. Creativity comes easy when you put in the Effort to set up an environment where you can comfortably be Weird</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Who is Wacky Wednesday?</h4>
        <p>You, or You and your friends, or You and some potential new friends</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>What is a Wacky Wednesday</h4>
        <p>It is an event in which you and any number of friends gather together for some creativity and socializing. It is recommended that each Wacky Wednesday have a 'pack leader', someone who has prepared a main creative event for everyone to participate in. The event can be whatever, some past examples include an improv excercises, painting, song writing and karaoke. Anything that involves creativity or learning works. Open art time and/or a music jam sesh can serve as a base event, you can keep it fresh by having optional themes. Besides that, the only other major element is creating a space where everyone involved feels as comfortable as possible to create and share with no judgement. Improv group exercises can be a great first or second Wacky Wednesday to help the group get in the "yes and..." mindset. </p>

      <h2>What is the Waldgrave?</h2>
      <p>
        For now, an outlet for ideas. One part of the Waldgrave is a nonprofit organization committed to creating free or at-cost open-source tools and products for people. What I find beautiful about technology is that once something is built, the marginal cost of use is often zero, so it can be shared easily. I don't think there is enough competition in these areas, stubhub would be an example. If two people want to exchange a ticket, why should the broker charge >$100 fee? It should be barely above the cost to make the exchange. The other part of the Waldgrave is trying to help fix major issues in our world, as seen in the goals section. My current focus is on a habit tracking app.

        <h4>What is Good?</h4>
        <p>
          Everything is Good, stop stressing the shoulds and worrying the woulds, can the coulds, everything is good.

          On the cosmic level, we are insignificant and might not even have free will, so why should we spend so much time with judgements? I think the universe is a good thing, and we are a part of it. We are basically patterns, we can lean into the rest of the universe or pull back, and we can choose to observe more or less. We can learn from those interactions, but I don't see the need to judge a part of the universe for being how it is, even if that part is part of me. This brings us to the individual level. People exist on top of a collection of waves, constantly riding ups and downs. But we only observe people at one point at a time. This creates a perception issue, especially for people you don't know. Living in a city, the effect is heightened. If you are around a lot of people, it is expected that you will pass by people at the bottom or top of their waves regularly. If a good driver makes a small mistake once every 100 trips, but you are driving past 400 cars a day, expect to see at least 4 small mistakes. Everyone is driving a different spaceship through the same spacetime, yours accelerates at a different speed than mine, so it may seem like I am intentionally going slow when in reality I am going full speed. Or my ship has had several flat tires thanks to the potholes in my neighborhood, so I'm a little more anxious driving around them than you. Everyone has ups and downs because that's the very nature of our universe, matter and existence is based on ripples. To promote existence as we know it, we want to push up the wavefunctions of others. To do that, we need to understand their waves, their magnitude, frequency, and where they are at right now. Getting in-sync is more important than it may initially seem, in our universe if you have two waves of equal magnitude and frequency destructively interfering (hitting each other when one is high and the other is low), they cancel each other out and both waves disappear. So if you are able to get on the same page as someone, you can boost their upswings and help temper their downswings.

          Additionally, you are a biological computer that is constantly re-programming itself based on neural paths taken. We have limited processing power that we manage, 'we' are not the full brain, we are a part at the top front that connects to the rest, and seems to make decisions. How we think actively shapes our brains, the repeated surges through neurons are like the strings vibrating to create the base waves of our universe. 86 billion little splashes shape the seas of your mind. Meditation has you focus on a background wave that is always there, the in and out flow of your breath. As a new thought rises out of an inner wave peaking, you acknowledge it, understand where it came from, and let it go. You find its amplitude and frequency, get in sync with it, and hug it away with some deconstructive acceptance. You accept that your brain is a product of the past so this thought is a reaction you cannot control. What you can control is your reaction to your brain's default reaction, and in meditation your reaction is to focus back on your breath. But outside of meditation, this enables you to react to your immediate reactions and evaluate the output of your brain, which in turn shapes your brain for the next time. This is where I think conscousness and free will live. Through this, I believe meditation enables you to be more intentionally you.
