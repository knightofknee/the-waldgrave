        Scientific Research
    </h5>
    <p>
        Day 1 all current and future research funed by taxpayers' money goes public. This is required in all future deals and all data will be collected willingly or through the full capabilities of the NSA. The info will be assembled and rid of all personal information, then tested by data experts to make sure it is clean. Then it is published online to a website that includes webhooks. US.Github comes online, open source software maintained by the US government but contributed to by anyone. Most shifts in contracts loses someone money, the research field has wasted so wontonly by not publishing all research, including studies that fail, in a highly accessible format. This should be done immediately because the waste has gone on too long and it's our money so it's our research, it should be accessible to all of us. That's the beauty of tech and progress, we need to move past models optimized for previous worlds. I think this is the sort of thing the Executive Branch can best contribute, improvement of the process of executing a goal for the greater good.

        <!-- Congress should be the leading force for setting the goals, outside of the core issues that a President chooses to define their platform by, subject to change. Congress simply has the democratic mandate, they are the connection to all of the people and their situations and opinions. -->
