As I gain users, I will look to create options and alternative versions to optimize to other tastes.

      Meditation:
    </h5>
    <p>
      Meditation might be as old as 7,000 years old. It is an exercise for the brain that has stood the test of time because it happens to work. It is also our only real direct exercise for the brain. You can do indirect things, like read or paint or improve your motor skills, but these are all indirect. Like you want to be fast but only play pickup basketball, you get in better shape but your heart health and speed would be much better if you did a running exercise, and you'd get in better shape while using less time. Or you want big biceps so you decide to carry boxes every day. It helps you be stronger, definitely, but it is not targeting the biceps like a lifting exercise could. Again, there is only ONE (please correct me if I'm wrong, mindfulness is kind of the same thing but I digress) surefire exercise for your brain; Meditation. After doing it just 5 minutes a day for a few weeks, there is observable growth in the prefrontal cortex. That's like the executive decision part of your brain, it's a big part of where "you" as in your consciousness resides. (how to meditate: sit with good posture (if possible), breathe through your nose, and count your breaths up to 5. After 5 or if you forget where you were, start over. As thoughts come to you, gently acknowledge where they are coming from and let them go, focus back on your breath. Thoughts that are harder to shake are like heavier weights. By struggling against them, you are working harder than when it is easy, so don't be discouraged. Focus on your breath like you haven't observed it before. When a kid is young, they see a brick wall it is interesting, later they learn that it is just another wall. Our brains are the same, just with different settings. You can choose to focus on a wall intently, and your brain can behave in similar ways to that of a learning child. In meditation, you pay attention to your breath, these physical sensations that you "feel" all of the time but do not pay attention to. Try to feel the air coming in your nose and into your lungs, or the way your chest rises and falls, or any other detail you can find. Focus your intent on your breath like Sauron's eye looking for Frodo)
