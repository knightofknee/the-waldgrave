      Meditation:
    </h5>
    <p>
      Meditation might be as old as 7,000 years old. It is an exercise for the brain that has stood the test of time because it happens to work. It is also our only real direct exercise for the brain. You can do indirect things, like read or paint or improve your motor skills, but these are all indirect. Like you want to be fast but only play pickup basketball, you get in better shape but your heart health and speed would be much better if you did a running exercise, and you'd get in better shape while using less time. Or you want big biceps so you decide to carry boxes every day. It helps you be stronger, definitely, but it is not targeting the biceps like a lifting exercise could. Again, there is only ONE (please correct me if I'm wrong, mindfulness is kind of the same thing but I digress) surefire exercise for your brain; Meditation. After doing it just 5 minutes a day for a few weeks, there is observable growth in the prefrontal cortex. That's like the executive decision part of your brain, it's a big part of where "you" as in your consciousness resides. (how to meditate: sit with good posture (if possible), breathe through your nose, and count your breaths up to 5. After 5 or if you forget where you were, start over. As thoughts come to you, gently acknowledge where they are coming from and let them go, focus back on your breath. Thoughts that are harder to shake are like heavier weights. By struggling against them, you are working harder than when it is easy, so don't be discouraged. Focus on your breath like you haven't observed it before. When a kid is young, they see a brick wall it is interesting, later they learn that it is just another wall. Our brains are the same, just with different settings. You can choose to focus on a wall intently, and your brain can behave in similar ways to that of a learning child. In meditation, you pay attention to your breath, these physical sensations that you "feel" all of the time but do not pay attention to. Try to feel the air coming in your nose and into your lungs, or the way your chest rises and falls, or any other detail you can find. Focus your intent on your breath like Sauron's eye looking for Frodo)

      Why Christopher Columbus nearly starved to death on his journey:
    </h5>
    <p>
Columbus, in his own words, considered Arabic to be "the mother of all languages.” It was the language of science from 8th to 12th centuries. Yet his biggest mistake came from reading Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly's "Imago Mundi", he assumed Roman miles when they were Arabic miles. That single mistake meant the distance to Japan was 12k Roman miles but he thought it was only 3k. He didn't have the boat tech to keep enough food for the journey, it didn't exist yet. He never would have left. He just “got lucky” that there was something before Japan. CC knew about Lief Erickson, he knew something was there. He also chose those results over the 1000+ year old results of Eratosthenes which had been tested over the centuries. The story and results of Eratosthenes also include his methods. How do you judge that math mistake? I think the hate of Christopher Colombus makes people want him to be an idiot. If you think he was an asshole, this should add up: Japan was an exotic civilization, luxury goods to trade, proper company to be had. There was no such promise from any ridiculous voyage to an unknown continent. But the asshole wanted his boat, and he didn't care if he risked the lives of all the people on the boat. One night while researching, he made the mistake and converted units incorrectly. The calculation gave him a glimpse of hope, and upon further scrutiny he curses poor Pierre and whoever decided to have a new unit of measure named the same as an old one, and screams, "anyone would be fooled by this". With no other viable options for getting a boat to explore the new world, Columbus saw his mistake as divine providence, a belief that only grew as his plan succeeded.

    <h5>Christopher Columbus Conspiracy: One faulty calculation and a journey across the world?, or one brief mistranslation turned opportuniy and a heist partway across the world?</h5>
    <p>Christopher Columbus was a time traveler imitating Chris Columbus. This math “mistake” was a brilliant find on his path to tricking the crown into giving him a ship and people. The original Chris Columbus realized the distance to Japan and devoted the next 20 years of his life or however it naturally happened to be able to build ships for the full distance to Japan. Chris, in the process of building big enough ships, made a business out of making the greatest navy at the time. The subsequent quick domination of the seas on the part of the Spanish lead to their dominance throughout the new world. The Time Traveling Columbus doesn't want to wait that long.  </p>

      Yoga
    </h5>
    <p>
      I can only speak from experience, but if you are inflexible, daily yoga (10 minutes a day can suffice) has great quality of life benefits. I'm nearing 3 months of trying it and I feel I can comfortably sit with close to ideal posture on my sitbones. A yoga instructor once said that in a class, 'sitbones', and I had no clue what it even meant. To sit as she was suggesting, I had to twist my then-inflexible body in a way that seemed quite unnatural and uncomfortable. But as I have stretched, I've become more aware of my body mechanics. I don't have aches and pains outside of a heavy lifting day. Walking and running still mystify me, honestly, it's really like you're swinging two golf clubs simultaneously, except you also have the flick of a wrist motion of your foot itself as well. There are many variables and many good enough solutions. If walking was so simple, there wouldn't be any bow-legged people, and everyone would walk similarly. Running takes it to another level by increasing the range of possibilities. At full speed, Usain Bolt is doing what looks like a butt kick and high knees at the same time. But I digress, yoga/stretching is like meditation, your body responds well to the consistency. The "time" you lose each day is well-past saved by the stable building process, 6 days of 10 minutes a day of yoga will do more for you than one 60 minute yoga session, and those 10 minutes can be flexibly scheduled wherever.

      I've had problems with lifting and basketball causing elbow pain. I'm hoping to get similar benefits from this as I do from yoga, to improve muscle growth and flexibility. I think it makes your other work more efficient and prevents injury. Will report back-- do PT instead, did that and it helped a lot, but still might be good
