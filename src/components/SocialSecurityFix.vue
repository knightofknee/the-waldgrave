      Initial Gameplan

      The first major step is education. Effectively everyone doesn't know why the current Social Security is the way it is. The main objective was to increase personal savings to help combat poverty among the elderly. It was NOT to help combat poverty among the elderly, the distinction is important. Otherwise the funds would come from 'normal' taxes. It failed monumentally. Similar to the war on drugs, social security ended up being a net negative on its main goal, it took money from people who could have saved it and instead of investing it themselves, the government uses it to pay social security now, lowering the personal savings rate while guaranteeing reduced benefits over time or the fund runs dry. As it is now, Social Security does contribute towards its value of helping the elderly, but its current structure is far from its original design.

      That's the way Social Security in the US went, but its failure was not always guaranteed. Congress slowly gutted the fund over time, but what if things had been different? To further explore the wavefunction of social securty possibilities, We aim to create a graphing/visualization tool for estimating what the current size of the fund would be given different decisions in time. These different choices will be options that the user can choose when viewing the model.
