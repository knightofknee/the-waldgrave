      TLDR:
      the universe will collapse on itself at a potentially infinite speed as the energy in empty space will be finally drained. The universe is very uniform, if you could keep your patch of spacetime together longer, you could outlast the uniform. It is the reversal of the big bang, any spacetime survivors on a collision course. Here we have a couple options:
      1. The energy of our universe is conserved in the process, and we have a new big bang and a complete cycle
      2. Our universe is just dying, it exists inside of a black hole in a universe that is also dying, except it is earlier in the process of decay.
        Maybe:
        a) the black hole "around" our universe crumbles and we have made it up a level
        b) before our universe-black hole crumbles to reveal the next level, everything in it is forced to collapse to a point with the collapse of spacetime. This adds up because a black hole appears to us to have an extreme amount of mass at a single point. That case is true for the beginning of our universe and the potential end. a black hole kind of squeezes spacetime into a tiny point, and it punches out into its own bubble. It is the same spacetime, just oozing into this bubble. That is part of why our universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, black holes grow.
          ba) it might create a condition where all universes have 1 or 0 survivors; if they had 2 or more, they would collide during the collapse

      So if you could manipulate your patch of spacetime well enough, you could outlast the universe
